 wrote a review Mar 22,I have received harassing emails from staff every single day saying I must upgrade my rokm because it will not accommodate my 2 month old infant. This is absolutely ridiculous. What kind of customer service and staff is this?? I have stayed at many 5 star hotels and never been harassed like this before.

 wrote a review Nov 2021,"What an incredible hotel. From the first greeting by the friendly door staff, a smooth an welcoming check in and then on to an uber luxurious room. I spent one night in a Devonshire suite which provided fantastic city views, notably The Gherkin which at night was spectacular. The room was modern yet luxurious and extremely comfortable. I got to experience all aspects of the hotel. Room service - super prompt and efficient The Straits Kitchen - delicious food, a wonderful Singaporean adventure was had. The staff were attentive, friendly and such fun characters. Ginger Lily - A great cocktail bar full of devious options. I cannot fault this hotel, if has to be the best hotel in London. I will certainly visit again.

 wrote a review Mar 21,"Excellent experience at the brand new Pan Pacific. This is sleek, stylish luxury hotel in the City (London’s financial district). The location is both good and bad due to that, depending on why you are in town. The hotel takes up the bottom half of a new skyscraper topped by residences. A lot of people aren’t familiar with the Pan Pacific chain… it’s more of an Asian and West Coast chain. The last one I stayed at was in Seattle, when it had just opened 15 years ago. This one is much better. As far as ambience and decor, it is on par with a Ritz-Carlton or St. Regis and maybe even a Four Seasons. (If I didn’t see the PP signage, I would guessed any of those three). ‘ I was traveling during Omicron so it was challenging to actually just get into the UK.

 wrote a review Feb 2022,"Wow. What a hotel.

I’ve already booked for next month (March), so you can probably tell I’m pretty crazy about this place, given the number of alternatives I could’ve gone for.

The main thing that sets Pan Pacific London apart is the staff. Every member of staff is friendly and courteous - they make every guest feel like a special member of an extended family.

Another incredible element is the quality of the food - Lorraine Sinclair and Cherish Finden really know how to put together a memorable and special meal! Whether that’s afternoon tea, Straits Kitchen, or room service. Everything we had was simply delicious.

We both enjoyed massages with Beatrice in the spa, and her skill was really second to none. I’ve paid more for massages in the past that were nowhere near as good, targeted, relaxing and effective. Cannot wait for another appointment with Beatrice!

The rooms are also incredible - clean, fresh, decadent. And gorgeous Diptyque toiletries too! Also, small things, like having a Nespresso machine in the room really made a difference.

We had a few niggly issues, so why the 5 stars? Quite simply because the team here LISTENS. I got to meet the General Manager and her assistant - both are so committed to making things right and making every guest’s experience enjoyable. I will always give 5 stars when I feel listened to - niggles happen, that’s life, but how problems are handled is what really shows the calibre of a hotel.

Overall, I cannot wait to stay again. This is an incredible addition to the London hotel scene.",50,40,"Bath, United Kingdom",43,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeachedExplorers,JessicaW,Date of stay: February 2022,Already Booked Another Stay Next Month!,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d23274923-Reviews-or10-Pan_Pacific_London-London_England.html#REVIEWS

 wrote a review Feb 2022,"I don’t normally set out to find fault with a hotel but I have to say that there was nothing, absolutely nothing about the Pan Pacific that I could fault or would even want tweaked in any way. Our whole stay was just fantastic. We had taken our four daughters with us for a two night stay to celebrate our twentieth wedding anniversary! The Dyson hairdryers were a real selling point with four teenagers! We also appreciated all the Diptyque products in the bathrooms! We had three double double rooms (two double beds in each) so we had plenty of space. Absolutely everything we could have needed was in the rooms. They were incredibly well stocked. We also used the swimming pool, sauna, steam room which was all just lovely, really relaxing, perfectly clean and the pool has great views over the streets in the City. We were really close to restaurants, shops, Liverpool St Station (for transport options) and Spitalfields Market where we ate a couple of times.

We also enjoyed evening drinks in the bar and the service was impeccable. We didn’t eat breakfast in the hotel but we were able to find plenty of places to eat close by.

What I loved most about the Pan Pacific was how quiet it was. I have stayed in many lovely hotels where noise has been an issue. I heard nothing at nights! That made for a perfect stay.

Drinks were good. Service was extremely good and quick. The staff couldn’t do enough for you. The only tiny thing that marred an otherwise perfect trip was the room temp. It took 24 hours to get the room to COOL and the room service team then turned it back to warm 21C again. I can’t sleep unless the room is COOL/COLD and I think a lot of people are like that.

 wrote a review Feb 2022,"We loved our first stay at the Pan Pacific. We were celebrating a birthday and this was acknowledged by the hotel upon check in and with a complimentary bottle of wine in the room. We also received complimentary drinks in both Silverleaf and Ginger Lily.

Even without these extras (which were much appreciated), we found the hotel to be very modern with great staff and a real five star experience. We had a deluxe room which is their entry level standard, on the eighth floor (there are 19 floors). The room was very smart, quite spacious and had a good view of the gherkin from the floor to ceiling windows. Great shower room and amenities throughout. Very comfortable super king size bed.

We had drinks in Silverleaf before heading elsewhere for dinner. The bar is in a separate building to the hotel and we met friends there. Although it was very quiet as it was only 6pm, all staff were very friendly and helpful - explaining the quite high-concept cocktail experience. But it was all fun and an interesting start to the evening.

We returned to the hotel after dinner for drinks in Ginger Lily, which again we enjoyed. I would say I preferred the ambience and setting of Silverleaf overall - more spacious.

Breakfast was fine - we had the continental buffet. There was a long delay in our coffee arriving. But this was acknowledged by the staff and apologised for.

Check out was very quick and smooth with a taxi arriving a couple of minutes after our request.

 wrote a review Feb 2022,"This hotel is incredible! Just a 1 minute walk from Liverpool Street tube, it’s brand new and we had the best time. We arrived early so they took our luggage for us whilst we went to Tower of London, we came back around 1:30 and they let us into our room early. They’d arranged balloons, cookies and an activity back for our little ones, as well as organising a treasure hunt for them to get a prize. So lovely !!! Everyone at reception was so friendly and welcoming. Thanks to Tom.

The room was immaculate, we had 2 doubles… it was gorgeous, we didn’t have much of a view on the 14th floor but also we didn’t pay the most expensive rate. Bathroom and shower, diptyque products all fantastic. Rooms were cleaned to the highest standard with lovely water, teas coffees, robes etc. And the shower one of the best I’ve ever had.

The children’s swimming times were from 4pm in the afternoon so we went down and all the staff were very friendly. The pool was well kept, lots of towels, a lady handing out water. If it was busy I’m not sure there would be enough beds but it is London. The only gross thing is one child spat out their chewing gum and left it on the side. The pool is quite nippy too! A lovely steam/sauna in the changing rooms though

The staff were incredible here, everyone is so friendly and nothing is too much trouble.

Ok the actual area isn’t the best in London for us as it’s quite corporate with all the banks around, but it’s near spitalifields and lots of good cafes, restaurants. The weather was awful so we ate in Straits for dinner. Singaporean food, absolutely delicious and catered for children. Expensive though so we opted for a coffee shop for breakfast.

 wrote a review Feb 2022,"The hotel is new-I think it opened towards the end of 2021. The decor is stunning with beautiful clean lines and warm colour schemes, creating a calming atmosphere. The bed was so comfortable and our room was spotlessly clean. The Diptyque toiletries were a lovely touch too. The staff are what really make this hotel special. They are warm, welcoming and approachable, and not what you expect for a 5 star London hotel where some staff members can occasionally be a little stuffy and cold. I really appreciated the extra effort made to interact with guests. We even had 2 lovely members of staff deliver my husband a slice of cake for his birthday whilst singing 'Happy Birthday' to him. This was such an entertaining and thoughtful touch. We can't wait to return. Thank you to the entire wonderful team.

 wrote a review Feb 2022,"My Wife and I often have a night or two as a getaway in The City every couple of months. We've stayed in a lot of hotels over the years in the area, mostly high end, including the likes of The Ned and The Vintry and Mercer. The Pan Pacific is the best yet, and our new favourite. We booked two nights but added a third.

The style of the hotel is stunning, modern, light and uplifting. The Spa is fantastic; the swimming pool is ideal. Plenty of room to grab a bed; never too busy, and a long pool for some lengths. The air temperature is kept warm so when you get out you never feel cold. The steam room is very.... steamy, as opposed to the ones that are more like lukewarm wet rooms

The room was also stunning, a big shower, bath, modern, perfectly clean. Electric curtains, large TV that could be angled as you needed. The bed was huge and comfortable.

Connectivity is great, with Liverpool Street just over the road providing quick access to the Central line (a s well as others), and loads of great, local choices to eat or shop just a stones throw away. Everything from the Duck and Waffle and Ivy, to a Tesco Express and McDonalds, all within a couple of minutes walk.

Best of all, the staff. The service is impeccable; Every member without fail were always smiling, happy, and interesting to talk to. You can feel the difference; it's a genuine happiness and interest, and not fake because they are told to do so.

Of course, this all comes at a price and it's far from the cheapest hotel you'll find, but compared to competitors it's great value for money given the experience and well worth it. Our previous favourite, The Ned, has become extortionate in price. Pan Pacific sits just below it in price but in our opinion exceeds it in every aspect. We would love to see some multi night offers at some point to keep it affordable so we can visit more often.

It goes without saying, of course we'll be back.",50,11,"Portsmouth, England, United Kingdom",9,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elliotp737,Elliot P,Date of stay: February 2022,So amazing we stayed an extra night.,NA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d23274923-Reviews-or30-Pan_Pacific_London-London_England.html#REVIEWS

 wrote a review Jan 2022,"On arrival staff were warm and welcoming. Cyril took us to our room and kindly talked us through the amenities there. He took an interest in what we had planned and maintained this interest throughout our stay. We liked the room and location for what we were doing this time in London. Clean bright and spacious. On our return after our first trip out there was a beautiful message and delicious dessert plates with a ‘Happy Birthday’ and this really added to our experience at the hotel. We had booked the pool for between 5pm and 6pm and this also was a lovely experience. The water, ambience and restricted numbers helped to ensure that everyone felt comfortable and could get a seat around the pool. Our only slight disappointment was when turn down service arrived as we were getting ready to go out before 7pm and so only gave us ice and water. On return after our night out it was a slight disappointment to return to our room as we had left it. However, we understand that Covid may have had a part to play in this as perhaps housekeeping staff were a little ‘thin on the ground’.
Checkout was easy and our luggage was stored so that we could collect it later. What made our stay was the non intrusive but attentive service. I often travel to Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia and this felt like service we receive over there.
I should also mention that we returned for test in the afternoon and this was a delight in the downstairs lounge. Your staff there were attentive, calm and welcoming and the ambience was just perfect. Tranquil and relaxing. We usually stay in Kensington but our experience will mean that we shall return.

 wrote a review Jan 2022,"We stayed at the Pan Pacific London on our anniversary. We were lucky to get an upgrade to a beautiful suite with a lovely view of the Dome of St Paul’s Cathedral. Careful attention to detail of the amenities needed by guests was impressive and those provided were of high quality. We have stayed previously in a deluxe room and were equally impressed with the beautiful decor and amenities then.
The Hotel itself is stunning and thoughtfully designed. The Orchid Lounge is very elegant with a beautiful fire to entice you in when it’s cold outside. The Wellness Floor offers a calming retreat from the stresses of everyday. Swimming in the infinity pool is the perfect place to relax and watch the world go by outside the window. We found it hard to drag ourselves from the heated loungers with weighted blankets in the relaxation lounge and although we didn’t use it, the gym looked very impressive.
We decided to dine in Straits Kitchen which we were so pleased about because the food was amazing.
The hotel has two bars. On our previous visit we had pre-dinner cocktails in Ginger Lily’s which had a lively atmosphere with people enjoying drinks and snacks. This time we visited Silverleaf which was a larger bar, both elegant and sophisticated with tasty cocktails. Recently opened it is certain to become a very popular bar to have drinks with friends.

 wrote a review Jan 2022,"So we weren’t sure we’d be able to go on this trip until we actually got on the train, so to find ourselves checking in was quite the treat. It was a trip planned to remind ourselves of Singaporean hospitality and great food, booked in the new sister hotel of somewhere we love to stay when in SIN.

The staff in this hotel are superlative, they have found the people they want from all over the city and it shows. Discreet, friendly service is the benchmark here.

There were some excellent points: Afternoon tea is a highlight and chatting with Cherish was lovely. Cocktails were another, when we were unsure of our order we were met with a comprehensive and relaxed explanation of the interesting menu.

The wellness floor is spectacular. Be aware that as a ‘family friendly’ hotel they only allow children in the pool for two hours a day. You also have to pay full price for 12+ but they’re not treated as adults and allowed to swim out of kids hour until 16+. Irritating for us but probably great for others.

Housekeeping was on point except for on New Years Day, when we came home to find our room hadn’t been made up at 4.00. A quick call down to reception remedied it, but it’s not what I expect at this price point.

The only real disappointment for me was the food offering. The hotel was running a slimmed down menu for the holidays. By slimmed down, I mean there was no SE Asian food. Nothing on the room menu bar CKT noodles, nothing for breakfast except Congee. I love both, but the menu online made my heart sing. No Laksa, no crab, no exciting breakfast, nothing that wasn’t good old English hotel food. Meh. I want to go to Singapore in London, please don’t reduce your menu to bacon, I can eat that at home!

 wrote a review Dec 2021,"I have been fortunate enough to stay three times since this hotel
opened in September 2021. What this hotel has achieved is just phenomenal. It surpasses even the best five star hotels in Singapore and elevates hospitality in London to a very different level. I have found this
rarely in London where there’s many 5 star hotels but most are ‘average’ or ‘good’ but not truly memorable or easily positively differentiated.

This hotel is all about service. It’s brilliant. The opening team assembled is from the great and good of the London luxury hotel scene. It’s personable, engaging, friendly, never stuffy and lives up to Pan Pacific’s values of sincerity.

The Wellness floor is excellent. It’s not the biggest in London but it’s big and bigger than most other hotels. The gym has very high quality equipment and the 18.5m lap pool is great to swim in and/or watch the city go by on Bishopsgate.

The food here is of course sensational. Lots of authentic and delicious Asian cuisine but also some western food available, particularly through room service. The Ginger Lily Bar is wonderful for a drink or two. They are constantly improving the drinks menu and there’s so much passion in what they are making. More bars to open in 2022! One highlight for many will be that Cherish Finden works here, so you will have a top notch afternoon tea experience!

The room is very comfortable, large by London standards and very clean. Full credit to the housekeeping team who keep the place immaculate. No desks in the room, if that’s important to you, but there are small tables that you could place a laptop on. Premier Rooms and above feature baths.

 wrote a review Dec 2021,"We booked a couple of nights here at short notice. The level of customer service was the best we’ve experienced in some time (possibly the only hotel I could rate at the same level is the Four Seasons). From emailing to ask for any requests ahead of our stay, to the welcome from every single member of staff and any requests being dealt with immediately.

The hotel itself is immaculate and just across from Liverpool Street station. We were in a Premier Double Double on the 16th floor with lovely views. We stayed with 2 teenagers and there was plenty of room and a huge bathroom.

It’s the little things that make the difference. We often book a family room but there’s only 2 robes, towels, toiletries etc. Here we had 4 of everything (and the robes were so nice that we contemplated buying one to take home). Nespresso machine, diptyque toiletries, electronic curtains, very comfortable beds. We had an early check in and late check out which was much appreciated (many hotels have charged us extra for this).

Breakfast was fantastic, with cooked options to order and a great buffet of fruit, bread, pastries, meats etc. Freshly squeezed juices were delicious.

Our one small niggle was the temperature of the pool which didn’t feel like the advertised 30 degrees. We did mention this to this spa and reception staff. The pool itself had great views and nice loungers to sit round in. The gym was possibly one of the nicest hotel gyms we’ve been in.

Overall, we loved the hotel and will definitely return. A big thank you to the staff who all went the extra mile for their guests.",50,NA,"London, United Kingdom",3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jmg4321,JoG,Date of stay: December 2021,Outstanding customer service and beautiful hotel,Trip type: Traveled with family,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d23274923-Reviews-or60-Pan_Pacific_London-London_England.html#REVIEWS
 wrote a review Dec 2021,"My daughter had found this hotel online. I wasn’t certain about booking purely because of the money but I decided life is short and she had waited a long time to celebrate due to Covid so I booked it.

I didn’t regret a penny.

From the moment we met Walter he made us feel at ease and although we turned up very early expecting to just leave luggage, our room was ready and they allowed us to check in. We were delighted.

Everything here is luxurious. Customer service is obviously paramount and they tended to greet me by name. Throughout our short stay they bent over backwards to be warm, friendly and professional. Always going the extra mile.

The food was excellent. The pool was spotless. It all felt like a 5 star hotel should. My daughter loved every second too! Thank you to all.

 wrote a review Dec 2021,"I am an independent travel agent so have stayed in many hotels and this hotel is hands down one of the BEST I have visited!
The service that was given to me was exceptional, they cater for every one of your needs! Before I had arrived I had been exchanging emails with Andrea, Lara and Rosheen who I got to meet on arrival. They personally took me up to my room and showed me all the amenities. It was my partners birthday so they had placed balloons in the room, a bottle of wine and arranged fresh rose petals to be delivered as well as a birthday dessert made by a famous pastry chef! Just incredible.
The food was sublime as well as the room service. The hotel room was beautiful and included underfloor heating in the bathroom as well as a great view of London. If you like taking photos this hotel is also a great location for this, especially in the spa / pool area and reception! Walter the door man is an amazing photographer and very helpful and friendly so definitely pay him a visit.

My room was fantastic & as a Gold member I was upgraded to an amazing 11th floor corner executive room which was incredibly spacious & had several floor to ceiling windows. The views are fabulous, mine looked onto the Gherkin & Can of Ham on one side, out over the city skyline from the other windows. Rooms are beautifully appointed & decorated, beds huge & uber comfy, curtains remote controlled & bathrooms top to bottom marble. Very generously stocked with lovely Diptyque products too. Reception staff were professional & polished, as were staff throughout the hotel. I didn’t dine in-house but had cocktails in the chic Ginger Lily bar. Breakfast was the only slight let down, food was absolutely fine, service polite & willing, but it was just … ordinary, in contrast to the wonderful rooms... a bit noisy, tables too packed in, the buffet small & unthrilling.

The rooms are beautiful with subtle luxury, great amenities, and an amazing view! Will miss the plush bathrobe and high quality toiletries.
The swimming pool area can get a bit crowded in the afternoon/weekends. But was quiet and relaxed in the morning.
Remember to make a reservation in advance if you want to experience their afternoon tea on a Saturday. Picture bellow is from a quick tea break on a Sunday.

The hotel's décor is a blend of Asian and European, and afternoon tea is the same. On offer is a traditional English afternoon tea and Kopi Tiam, which is a Singaporean inspired “celebration”

We had one of each – it's a good way to mix and match, try out the new, but still have the well loved elements of the traditional afternoon tea.

The food itself was excellent, sandwiches, scones all perfect, and the Kopi Tiam was a revelation (perfect dim sum, mushroom bao etc).

Cherish Finden is well known from TV cookery/travel programmes and as Executive Pastry Chef has created something original and brilliant (which given how congested the afternoon tea scene is in top London hotels is a real achievement).

The “house blend” tea matches the food perfectly.

 wrote a review Nov 2021,"Stayed 3 nights and the hotel was busy in spite of only being opened 2 months ago. The quality of the new building is exceptional and ultra contemporary and there is a strong focus on staff team spirit to welcome you. The location is perfect for visiting couples like ourselves but families (and their pets!) are also well catered for. It is close to the Tower of London and the West End but we enjoyed the markets (Brick lane, Columbia st flower and Spitalfields). The area has a real buzz.

The room was was state of the art from the electric curtains, televisions and air-conditioning all controlled from switches conveniently located. Views from the rooms are excellent in the heart of the city with its high rise buildings. Our bathroom had both a rain shower and a bath. The beds were super comfortable and wide.

Pan Pacific has a wellness centre with an infinity swimming pool overlooking the square and the gym is equipped with the latest fitness equipment.

Quality of the food in the restaurant was outstanding and the cocktail bar must be one of the best in London.

Unfortunately we did not have time for the afternoon tea but speaking to fellow guests they said that was faultless. Something for us to look forward to next time!

 wrote a review Sep 2021,"Utterly remarkable all the way
10/10
Liked · A wonderful 5-star experience so very, very close to Liverpool Street Station. - From the moment I approached the doormen I was taken care of in the nicest possible, elegant and inobsequious way I remember of any 5-star anywhere. From Alex (?) the concierge, to Kelly the receptionist who was kind enough to show me to my room personally and give me a charming induction to the tech involved. Although this was mostly work, my wife and I managed to get a lovely later-evening out of it. I think the best recommendation one may afford a place is to return, and we’re returning very soon for a non-work related, full three-night weekend in the City and beyond.

Disliked · Room for minor improvement: 1) At breakfast it would be really nice to have your own pot of coffee on the table, or at least having it served a little more quickly (this is my darling wife) … 2) I think being able to get a ‘proper’ English breakfast tea at appropriate strength in one’s teapot at breakfast might be nice, i.e. two to three teabags of the ‘Pan Pacific House English Breakfast Tea’ per pot might be a good idea, and not just the one. I know, I could have asked for it but didn’t, so as just to see what they might do. The blend of the breakfast tea however was very good indeed … 3) It would also be nice to have the breakfast-included bits of the menu - in my case poached egg on toast - be displayed a little less ‘coldly & basic’, e.g. maybe a little decoration like dried parsley sprinkled over the plate, etc.",50,1,"Manningtree, United Kingdom",3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lord_Bobbles,Lord Hobson,Date of stay: September 2021,Utterly remarkable all the way,Trip type: Traveled on business,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d23274923-Reviews-or130-Pan_Pacific_London-London_England.html#REVIEWS
 wrote a review Sep 2021,"As a frequent traveler who enjoys staying in hotels, I thought I have seen and tried most types and experienced the various management teams.
So when I was offered to stay in a brand new hotel that opened only a week before my arrival named Pan Pacific London, I thought why not try it, especially that it’s location was very accessible and close to my daughter university in East London.
The Pan Pacific London exceeded my expectations at all levels for a London hotel, starting from the facilities quality and premises, to the more important hotel team, at all levels.
You will always be greeted with your name, and recognized whenever you call for any service. They have a diverse team that is United in their service standard and professionalism.
You will always be made to feel at home through your use of the facilities, which are brand new and of the highest quality that you may find in London.
The food variety and quality, are of the highest standards. Whether in their buffet breakfast or in-room dining, you will taste the best quality of items offered. Special dietary requirements like Gluten free bread and types of non-dairy milks are easily available and provided upon your request. Their service and team at the various departments all share a smile on their face and a will to provide you, their client, with what you need or request . They are really special.

 wrote a review Sep 2021,"This is a really lovely hotel. All the staff are incredibly welcoming and attentive (perhaps a little too attentive, if you prefer more anonymity in your hotel stays!)—going above-and-beyond to make sure guests feel valued and well-looked after.

We arrived just after midday & the reception staff didn’t hesitate in checking us in early.

Ours was a double room on the 16th floor which was immaculate and spacious with super comfortable furnishings, great amenities (especially the very generous Diptyque toiletry offerings) and excellent views of the City.

My partner had work to do, so I made a beeline for the infinity pool on the 4th Floor which was a surreal treat—swimming with views over Devonshire House/Square. The water temp was nicely cool but it was still pretty chlorinated (disappointing for those of us with reactive/sensitive skin) so I couldn’t stay in for too long and didn’t return for the rest of our one-night stay.

I was looking forward to having a Steam Room after my swim, but this was still being fitted and wouldn’t be opening for a week or so … which leads me to the rationale behind my lower rating for Pan Pacific.

The Pan Pacific London is an exceptional hotel, or at least it will be once all of its amenities finally open.

Like the Steam Room, its café (Patisserie) hadn’t finished being built/fitted yet, nor had another of its restaurants. On top of this, there were a few technical teething problems that impacted our stay: room keys that didn’t work; lifts that wouldn’t move on four occasions (apparently, due to some security system migration); and a TV issue when trying to work the ChromeCast that led to a white menu panel superimposing itself onto the screen for about an hour. I’ve no doubt the wonderful staff would have attended to this problem if we had made mention of it, but these are the sort of minor things that one doesn’t want to have to deal with when you’re only away for one night.

If I hadn’t paid for our stay with Avios points, then I might have been more disappointed by these hiccups and the lack of the full Pan Pacific experience, but despite all of this—I do highly recommend this hotel & would be happy to return to avail of its full suite of offerings at a later date.",40,2,NA,2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/292rudih,Rudi H,Date of stay: September 2021,Great service/room with some minor teething problems,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d23274923-Reviews-or140-Pan_Pacific_London-London_England.html#REVIEWS

 wrote a review Sep 2021,"If you are looking for a secret gem in the city the Pan Pacific cannot be beaten. A brand new hotel with incredible views, great location and sublime staff.
The whole team although only open for a couple of weeks make your stay incredible.
The attention to detail is amazing. The spa has an amazing infinity pool and luxurious places to shake off your stress. Our son though the robe in the spa the most luxurious thing he had ever worn, actually both our children thought it the most beautiful and luxurious hotel they had stayed in and we have travelled extensively.

The food is fabulous and has some really wonderful Asian dishes.
The rooms are out of this world with wet room showers, Diptique toiletries and incredibly good quality amenities. The bed dominated a massive room but in the best way possible. The offering is nothing like we have experienced before. Unique, impressive. A major thank you to Anne, Stephen and Victor and all of the team for making our stay incredible. The boys want to go back at half term.
