Mar 2020,Having stayed at a sister hotel in Hanoi we had high hopes for this hotel. Some things are good. Mainly the staff who are super friendly and helpful. The position of the Hotel a short walk from the bars and restaurants but not noisy. Now the bad bits. It is very dated. I can only liken the feel of it to when I used to travel around the former soviet states in the early days and you took your own bath plugs. The room we had was large (needlessly so). It had a jacuzzi bath with a hand held shower. I am suspicious of jacuzzi baths as if not regularly cleaned they become pretty putrid. Having run the pump for 20 seconds the stench was unmistakable. Probably not cleaned for months. The hand held shower was stupidly powerful. I mean painfully so. It had no where to hang it on,30,156,"Shoeburyness, United Kingdom",266,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A9328WLsimonw,Simon W,March 2020,Bit of a shame,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293926-d4357913-Reviews-Hue_Serene_Palace_Hotel-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html

Anyways, in the end it was an exceptional mishap as the night auditor had to step out urgently and wasn't present on my call for complaint. I always say that a good hotel is also assessed by how it handles these unfortunate matters.

Room was functional but clean. Bars on the window in our 3rd floor room for security purposes as it backed on to nearby roofs. Housekeeping very eager to get into room of a morning so could have done with Do Not Disturb sign being provided.

Breakfast was fine although maybe could have done with some additional cold meats/cheeses being offered. Ate in the restaurant one night and that was again good.

Location was excellent with all sorts of bars/restaurants within walking distance.

Feb 2020,"Hue Serene Palace rooms are spacious, beds are comfy with ample pillows. Good selection for breakfast especially the hot entrees, fruit juices and fresh fruit. Towels could be whiter in colour and shower curtain and bathtub area smells of mildew. You can rent a motorbike from the hotel for a full day or half a day if you want to take a spin around the city or rent one from the place across the street.
There can be heard echoes and noises from the hallway or the floor above you at all hours due to the hard surfaces used, which can be annoying. Elevator is very handy for luggage and I appreciated the 2 free bottles of water per day (previous hotel provided 2 bottles on the first day only). There’s also an intimidating, scowling old white dude in shorts that’s there almost all the time (maybe he’s the owner) who needs to learn how to smile.

Nov 2019,"The redeeming quality of this hotel is the staff service. We were greeted upon arrival and promptly given some fruit juice and fresh fruit. We arrived early but did not have to wait long until a room was ready for us. We were escorted by a bellman and he showed the various features of the room. The two waitresses in the restaurant at dinner were also very pleasant and delivered prompt service.

The location wasn't ideal. It was tucked away in a back alley - a mile away from the Citadel. We don't mind walking it but for some, it might be a little too far out. The bathroom wasn't the best - the lighting is pretty dim and the caulking in the tub area was terrible. Therefore, it did not feel completely clean. We checked out around 6am and when we walked into the lobby, the overnight shift (bellman and night auditor) were literally sleeping on the couch in the lobby and a thin mattress on the floor. We had to wait for them to wake up and put on their shoes. I understand that this is an independent hotel, but as a traveler who works in the hotel industry, this was disappointing and honestly, a little irritating, especially since we had to be somewhere at a certain time. It is an overnight shift, but that's your shift to be on duty and to be attentive to any and all guest needs.",30,5,NA,3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maianhtran09,maianhtran09,November 2019,Only good for one night,NA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293926-d4357913-Reviews-or30-Hue_Serene_Palace_Hotel-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html#REVIEWS
Nov 2019,"We spent two nights at this hotel in beautiful Hue and the service was impeccable. The staff was beyond friendly and helpful, always greeted us with a smile and went out of their way to make us comfortable. The ladies at the front desk were beyond helpful, making phone calls to set up transport for us and giving us good tips for site seeing. Their restaurant, the Serene Restaurant, has some of the best, if not the best food in Hue. You must have their Bun Bo Hue or the Banana Flower salad, so good! Their restaurant staff is also super friendly and made us feel right at home. The rooms are modern, comfortable, clean and quiet. If your into shopping and nightlife this hotel is only a couple of blocks from the hustle and bustle of Vo Thi Sau street.
We used the hotels car service to get from Da Nang to Hue and back to the Da Nang airport. Our drivers, Minh and Hai were both excellent, safe drivers. They were both kind and accommodating. I would definitely recommend using the hotels car service as they are safe, professional and use late model cars. Our first driver Minh was great, driving us from DAD to My Son, Hoi An, Hi Van Pass over look and always asking to make sure we were comfortable and if we want to stop for pictures. Our driver taking us back to Da Nang, Hai, was very friendly as well and funny. Hai made a two and a half hour ride fun and feel short. He was nice enough to stop and buy us some water and some sweet snacks for the ride. To me it’s the little things that count to make for an excellent experience and these driver definitely did that for us. If you don’t use this car service you’re missing out.

Overall, Hue has become our favorite city. The city has wonderful cultural attributes, and some of the kindest and friendliest people we met while in Vietnam. That’s saying a lot since most everyone in Vietnam is friendly!",50,NA,NA,4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T1129IQcarlosp,Carlos P,November 2019,Great Hotel,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293926-d4357913-Reviews-or40-Hue_Serene_Palace_Hotel-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html#REVIEWS
Nov 2019,"I have been around, living in hotels in many countries and Vietnam, this is the hotel I would stay always, despite being tucked away in a tiny lane and in my opinion, consider this hotel amongst the top I have stayed in. The hotel location is neither urban nor rural because if you sit on the balcony you can hear the frogs sing after a rainy day and the cockerel crowing in the morning, with new buildings sprouting up in the surrounding landscape. (My concern is that Hue might develop too fast and lose the feel of a slightly laid back town to become just another modern town of coffee houses and restaurants and shopping centres.) I often sit at the balcony to meditate as the moon sets and watch the sunrise illuminating the growth progress of the city listening to the sounds of a country side setting.

The hotel ambience is one of a family hotel with a restaurant serving the best food in Hue. The staff here are always very helpful and what is important about hotel customer service, like a 6 star premium hotel, is that they remember customer preferences. They don't use a computer database here, just warm loyal staff who know the guest well.

Even if there are newer and modern hotels in Hue, my choice will always be this hotel. Never have I seen so many loyal guest who would stay for weeks or months. The staff seriously makes the difference and the boss and management of the group should really bear this in mind.

Another great thing about this hotel is the english language fluency of most of the staff , you get what you want when you ask the staff in english. I note that there are front desk staff like Alan who speaks basic Mandarin and I think I overheard him speak a European language, these are the people who would help bridge the communication gaps existing in many Vietnamese hotels. In developing countries, management normally encourage staff with a passion to communicate in another language like this by sponsoring them for language course as it is definitely a competitive advantage for the hotel to have such staff in the growing competition.",50,92,"Singapore, Singapore",513,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeffchia88,jeffchia88,October 2019,A hotel away from home with high standards of customer service.,NA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293926-d4357913-Reviews-or40-Hue_Serene_Palace_Hotel-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html#REVIEWS

Oct 2019,"I had a mixed experience during my stay with Hue Serene Palace Hotel.
Pros: restaurant staff
Cons: driver booked through hotel, WiFi, showerhead

The woman who checked us in was very pushy about having us book a driver through them when we had only just walked in the door. This was after we were mobbed by men as soon as we got off the train to hire them as drivers but we were already warned to only take the white and green taxis in Hue. We had to tell the Serene Palace reception lady more than twice that we needed some time to think about it and she finally backed off. Please chill out and let us enjoy our welcome drinks and fruit without trying to up-sell as soon as we walk in the door. The WiFi was not working while we waited in the lobby and I was told they had some issues with the WiFi but it would work in the room. I was trying to make arrangements while waiting for the room to be ready and when we were allowed in the room the WiFi on the floor did not work. I called the front desk and it eventually worked.

We had a special occasion to celebrate and the staff kindly made swans from towels on the bed and a mini bottle of Vietnamese wine which was very much appreciated. The showerhead didn’t stay at the right angle which was difficult to use but a minor point.

We ate the set menu for dinner at the hotel and everything was delicious and the servers were very attentive. We also had breakfast and they even packed some fruit for us to take on the road. This was the highlight of our stay.

The low point of our experience was that we booked the Serene Palace driver (this is their driver and the car even had giant letters advertising the hotel) to take us to My Son sanctuary and then Hoi An. At $90 USD I thought it was a bit expensive for a driver (not a tour guide). But the hotel told us it was because of the tolls which add up to $15 USD alone. We trusted the hotel and told the driver we only wanted to go to My Son as we already came from Danang and didn’t need to go anywhere else. He said he would only stop if we wanted to stop at places for photos but we told him more than once just go to My Son. At a couple points on the drive we asked how much longer as it was taking us quite a bit longer than expected and we realized he was driving us through Danang. We arrived at My Son not at the expected 2.5 hours, but it took us 4 hours! He ended up taking us on local roads and avoiding some of the toll roads.

No one likes to feel taken advantage of and so I advise caution before booking a driver through Hue Serene Palace Hotel. I am not sure if the driver did this on his own to pocket the extra money but ultimately the hotel needs to stand behind their employees’ behavior.

So one star for the driver, 5 stars for the restaurant, 3 stars for the front desk hustle and I give an average of 2-3 stars for the Hue (Not-so) Serene Palace Hotel.",30,53,"San Francisco, California",28,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tripkey,tripkey,October 2019,"Great restaurant staff, needs some improvement",NA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293926-d4357913-Reviews-or40-Hue_Serene_Palace_Hotel-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html#REVIEWS

I booked my own activities (highly recommend the I Love Hue lady motorbike food tour), but they were happy to provide recommendations. Lots of things in walking distance, yet the location down a small alley made it quiet.

The ac unit was a little noisy, but it also helped with white noise. Mine did not have a timer like another review mentioned. I was right by the elevator but barely heard any noise.

The staff were, to a person, very helpful and friendly. The waitresses in the restaurant were exceptionally nice. No-one tried to sell me on tours etc, for which I was grateful.
The breakfast is a combination of buffet and a la carte. I helped myself to the buffet: cereal, milk, tea, coffee, 4 different kinds of juice, croissants, baguettes, fruit, yoghurt, toast, ham, tomato, cucumber & lettuce. It was all very fresh & tasty.

The hotel is a few streets back from all the bars & restaurants so fairly quiet. Some reviews have said the building is noisy. Apart from the occasional chair scraping and, once, children in the stairwell, I slept soundly and wasn't unduly disturbed.

An easy walk to the action and an easy walk to a quiet retreat.

Modern hotel , great food and staff very keen to be helpful. Laundry service is very good value ( USD 1 per kilo at time of writing )

Breakfast is very varied and very good. Incredible juices, totally natural and the amount of fruit available.
The location scares a bit, because it is a very narrow street. A little away from the Citadele. But with a taxi (very cheap), in 5 minutes you're there.
I recommend upgrading the amenities. The amount of shower soap that they put for 4 people is fair.

The front desk team led by Ms Mary assist you with a warm smile & by the time your Check-in formalities are done, you are served a welcome drink with fresh cut fruits. The rooms are very spacious with elegant furnishings & classy interiors. Amenities include wall mounted wide LCD & AC, electric kettle, Minibar, Intercom, wardrobe & clothes rack, Sofa seats with Coffee Table & Desk, clean linen & very comfortable large sized bed, attached shower & premium toiletries. Overall, nothing less than a 5 Star property. Just 5-7 minutes walk to thye riverside promenade, 8-10 minutes walk to the Night market. The Forbidden City ( Citadel-Palace-Royal Antiques Museum) are about 2 Kms away while the 3 popular Emperor Tombs are 6-8 Kms away ( the total distance travelled for completing the Tomb tour is approx 25-30 Kms ). The Hotel lies in the touristy zone, most happening area of the city with lots of dining options. The bus station is little more than 1 Km away while the railway ( Train) station is about 3 Kms away from this hotel. We preferred the Bricks Cafe & Mr. Thinh's Fries nearby. The hotel's restaurant too serves relishing food. Indian cuisine too, is available just 5 minutes walk from the hotel at Shiva Shakti Restaurant, managed by the famous chain - Ganesh Indian Cuisine. The breakfast served by the hotel is awesome with lots of options to choose from.

Jul 2019,"The staff at Serene Palace are amazing. I know we get excellent service in Vietnam as a whole, but this staff really stands out above the rest. Not only do they help out with the usual things like tours and flights, but they really seem to take a special interest in each guest. They are very personable.

The rooms were very clean and spacious. The bed was comfortable. If you like having outdoor space, I recommend you upgrade to a balcony room. There is no other outdoor space. The front of the hotel is on an alley with no space for chairs to sit. There is space to sit inside the lobby though.

The restaurant in the hotel is fabulous. It is currently ranked the #1 restaurant in Hue. (At the time of my visit, July, 2019.). It was so good, I didn’t eat anywhere else while in Hue. They have a Hue specialty menu, which I worked my way through, and everything was delicious. I especially liked the item that comes with about 6 little dishes. I can’t remember the name but will attach the picture. Don’t miss this!

In the restaurant, all the staff were super friendly. However, Sally is something special. I caught a cold just before arriving to the hotel, and she made me a special ginger tea with fresh cut ginger, lime and honey. Not only did she do this for me once, but she did it every meal for the 3 days I was there. By the time I left the cold was gone. She takes a special interest in her customers and makes you feel like a friend. In my 3 weeks of travel to over 8 hotels and many more restaurants, Sally stands out above the rest for customer service.

May 2019,"Me and my partner traveled down from Hanoi via train (13 hour over night), we arrived exhausted and wanting to crash somewhere asap, however we arrived at 9am, and check in was not until 2pm.

The team at the Hue Serene Palace hotel were incredible, the welcomed us warmly and offered a nice refreshing drink and fruits (Much needed). They managed to sort out our room within 15 minutes of arrival! The beds were comfy rooms very spacious and clean.

Location is right next to the busy streets where there is plenty of street food/shops/restaurants and things to do, whilst also being tucked away in an alleyway making it nice and quiet if you want that!

We were able to hire bikes and explore the city and the staff gave good recommendations. We also organised hiring bikes from the hotel to our next stop on da nang and the staff were great!

May 2019,"The staff at this hotel was very friendly and helpful. Kelly answered when I called from the airport to ask how much I should pay for my taxi and when I arrived to the hotel she took care of my check-in. Kelly took her time to go over the Hue map with me and helped to create my plan for Hue and book my tours. I told her I wanted to go to my room to think about all the options she gave me and she didn’t pressure me into anything, she just told me they would be there when I was ready. The room was a good size and the balcony was a nice touch. I had an awesome view of the city. There was plenty of storage space for unpacking your bags. My only issue with the room was the hand held shower vs the shower being on the wall. The ladies in the restaurant were always pleasant for breakfast. They offered cooked to order options for breakfast and then they had a fruit and bread buffet to go with your entree. The location was great for walking around the town. I caught a taxi to the Citadel and walked back. I was glad I chose to walk back because I noticed how close the walking streets were with tons of food options.

May 2019,"First, I must thank the attentive and friendly staff at Hue Serene Palace Hotel for a very memorable and enjoyable first trip to Hue City, and to Vietnam. This includes the front desk, the housekeepers, the bell boys and separate kitchen waitresses and cooks. The restaurant in the hotel is excellent but a separate business operation so it will be covered in another TripAdvisor report.

Prior to arrival, several emails were exchanged with the hotel staff to arrange for transportation from the airport located a few miles south. When I got off the plane and made my way outside the Phu Bai Airport terminal, private transportation was waiting for me as promised. Off to a good start, I had a great ride into town taking in the sights and taking photos and video clips from the front seat.

The Hue Serene Palace Hotel is located in a busy alley just a block or two from a main thoroughfare which parallels the Perfume River just to the north. I was dropped off in front of the lobby and hotel staff collected my single, handcarry bag. Upon introducing myself to the front desk, I was immediately presented with a plate of fresh, tropical fruits and a juice drink while the hotel staff got me all signed in. They did the work, while all I had to do was relax and enjoy. I noticed right away that the hotel lobby and front desk area was exceptionally clean, modern and stylish. With check in complete, I spoke with Maya (her chosen western name) for several minutes regarding plans for tours of Hue and excursions in the coming days. Maya was very cheerful and helpful in getting everything arranged. She also had a great sense of humor and spoke English very well. I can't emphasize enough how hard everyone worked to make sure I was having the best vacation stay possible.

The room looks exactly like it does in the photos, fresh, clean and exceedingly neat. Everything is up to date and the room itself affords plenty of space to move around. The bedding and linens were excellent and made for a very comfortable place to sleep after spending hours exploring the ancient city and surrounding areas. The hotel also left a fresh plate of fruit in the room every day which was a nice touch. For those who may have left their tablet or laptop at home, each room is equipped with a desktop personal computer with internet connectivity. There was also a small safe located in the room suitable for passports and important travel documents and perhaps a cell phone. The WiFi network in the building had very good speed and I didn't experience any noticeable or significant dropouts. The WiFi was easily good enough to make FaceTime calls with clear video. My room was on the sixth floor but fortunately there is an elevator. My sixth floor room was in the front of the building and with the curtains opened featured a really unique and picturesque view of the surrounding rooftops near the hotel. The room also featured a balcony which I used mostly to take photographs or listen to the sounds of the city at night.

The bathroom was really nice and well maintained, again just as it looks in the photos on the website. A glass shower enclosure with a multiple outlet water delivery, spray, rain or just faucet. The housekeeping staff did as good of a job with keeping the bathroom tidy as they did with the rest of the room.

Lets see, there was also a small refrigerator in the room as well a coffee pot with instant coffee. There was also a large flat screen TV in the room which I watched mostly to fet a feel for local Vietnam programming. The room was fully air conditioned, a necessity for the hot months, but it took a while for the smaller unit to cool the room down. The AC and power shut down once the electronic room key is removed from the wall slot. Despite the minor inconvenience, the room did cool down sufficiently. On a positive note, the noisy A/C compressor was located outside, on the balcony, so the room was very quiet.

My stay in the Hue Serene Palace Hotel was terrific and made for one of the most memorable visits anywhere. The hotel staff deserves special recognition for their awesome guest service.

May 2019,"Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights. On the night of our arrival we were escorted to our room with a lovely view of the city. The room was quite hot, but we were told it would cool down in a bit. When we returned from dinner, the air conditioner in the room was not really working. It was late and the maintenance team was not available. The bellhop for the hotel came to the room and worked tirelessly to get it working and it did improve slightly. He also brought up a fan to help keep the room cooler that night. The next day the maintenance team fixed the unit and we could sleep the night without issue. So, while initially disappointed, the service at this hotel really did stand out. Considering there was little that was under their direct control, the staff all tried very hard to make up for the shortcomings of our initial night.

We also used the laundry service offered by the hotel, which was brilliant. I had stained a shirt the previous week and tried to remove the stain myself with no luck. I had no expectation that it would be removed by the hotel laundry service. Too my surprise the shirt came back spotless! I would also add that the breakfast that came with the room each day was marvelous. Lots of options. Plenty to eat. So, high marks for that.

When we checked out of the hotel, we had been given a discount for the trouble the air conditioner (or lack of) had caused. So, bonus points for that.

Other good points: Located close to everything - we walked to the Citadel but some may find this a bit too far. Nearby restaurants and bars provide many options as well.

In closing, my only reason for a 4 instead of a 5 is that I think the hotel does need an upgrade, at least in the air conditioning. It was quite an old unit. Even when it was fixed the room remained hotter than expected. Again, this is not something the staff can fix. That will require an owner to invest in some upgrades. So, I do recommend staying here, just be aware that the coolness of your room in the 37 degree heat may be a bit less than you expected.

Feb 2019,"Stayed two nights and had arranged pick up from airport, which went smoothly. Hotel is situated on a very narrow street/alley off the main road but location is good as walkable to the river and centre. Given a nice room on the top floor with a balcony (shame it rained and we couldn’t use it!) plenty of space to open suitcases, which can sometimes be an issue in smaller rooms. Would have preferred a walk-in shower rather than the jacuzzi bath but as it was only for two nights, coped ok. Didn’t experience any noise issues. Good wi-fi.
Restaurant and its staff very good and we enjoyed some nice meals and breakfasts there. Offers on various things throughout the day (we enjoyed free tomato salad with lunch).
Organised a City Tour through them to the Citadel, boat trip etc, which was good.
Note: for those with mobility issues, there is a flight of steps leading up to the hotel.

The staff were incredibly friendly and attentive, and made sure everything was to my liking at all times - which was very sweet! As a solo traveller, they made me feel right at home and even gave me some extra food at breakfast some mornings to keep me going for the day which I thought was just lovely. The room was bigger than I thought it would be which is always a nice surprise and a bonus, and it was kept very clean throughout my entire stay. The rooms are spacious and comfortable and the beds are very soft. The price of the hotel is excellent considering what is included - breakfast every morning was delicious. There is so much to choose from and a small buffet or fruit, cereals, pastries and bread which you can help yourself to throughout the morning.

Feb 2019,"Just left for the airport after staying three nights at Serene Palace Hotel! Best money we’ve spent so far. As other reviews show, the staff is extremely hospitable and welcoming. They really look after you best they can and make sure your stay in boyh Hué and the hotel is enjoyable and comfortable, which it truly was! Nice sized lobby with a little ”pond” with fish in, sophisticated restaurant with AMAZING breakfast (lots to choose from) and the rooms were beautiful! Spacious and clean, even had a computer in it!

I’ve seen some reviews saying beds were hard and/or loud but this wasn’t my experience at all. I found the bed to be perfectly soft, the pillow was awesome and the AirCon was hardly audible in QuietMode. Often the shower is somewhat questionable in terms of heat and power of the jets but not here! Spacious shower with glass walls/door, very efficient and comfortable jets! Had to fiddle slightly with getting the right temperature but we did eventually! I don’t know how the rooms are different but we were in 405 and have no complaints!

Feb 2019,"It’s not often we are torn on a hotel review - but we are this time. Usually it’s either very good or very bad or simply indifferent. This time we are torn because the staff of the Hue Serene Palace are by far the best thing about the hotel. In fact, they make up all the good things about the hotel. They are friendly, helpful, eager to please, professional and they make a good breakfast. However, a hotel stay is a summation of many things - not just efficient bell boys and friendly staff on the front desk (hello to Alan, Maya, Kelly and Julia). The price is good in comparison to Vietnamese hotel pricing generally. There is good bang for buck. The hotel is consistently spotless, the housekeeping staff are excellent. The cleanliness is aided by the hard surfaces, tiles etc, everywhere. BUT - and I hate for there to be a but as the staff really have tried to make our stay in Hue wonderful and kudos to them for that. BUT - The most important thing for us in a hotel is the quality of sleep - defined by the comfort of the beds and the soundproofing of the property. The linens on the bed were fine - clean, white cotton, nice weight of quilt/duvet/doona - cosy with the Air Con on. However the bed bases are just hollow plywood boxes placed directly on the hard surface floor. Every move makes a loud noise. Every roll, every turn and we can only imagine how that noise transmits to the floors below. The mattresses are also hard. Not firm, not comfortable, not ‘could be better’ - they are hard. So hard, the hotel has already added 2 mattress toppers to them and a mattress protector on top of that. Still hard, even with all the glitter. Also, it’s a sad fact of life that mildew is a fact of life in Asia - but the bed in 501, closest to the door, also has a strong mildew whiff to it (but it’s sitting on a wooden box, so can’t ventilate so understandable). We came to this hotel because reviews said the beds were comfortable - but going forward we will discount any reviewers from anywhere in Asia as the concept is somewhat different to western travellers. Right - so that’s the first half of sleep quality - not good, in fact terrible. The second half of sleep quality is soundproofing. There isn’t any. The room we were in initially had someone either repeatedly vomiting or hoicking and coughing in a death-defying manner in the room above. Our first room also had a mildewy/fausty smell which didn’t clear even with the Air Con used and the very small window opened (note.... avoid the standard rooms. Often called ‘Superior’ on the booking sites... whatever the base level room is... just don’t - in particular Room 503). Right - the hoicking/vomiting/coughing...above us, repeatedly. In graphic detail. The walk to the loo - the clomping back, the scraping of furniture, the return trip, the flushing... first evening 3 times? and first morning - all over again. The hotel very kindly shifted us to another room - which was a significant upgrade and we are of course very grateful for that. It doesn’t solve the major soundproofing issues in a building seemingly not built for purpose. Water can be heard running/flushing/draining most of the time. Someone in the room above us on our final night of 4 nights decided to either jump up and down on the bed - or do exercise - possibly skipping - for an hour or so in the evening and again the next morning. Like bass music, without the music. The man next door has a bad cough, the housekeeping are doing their thing, the doors slam by default and the electronic locks are dicky - that’s a tech term for beeping repeatedly and annoyingly, but only sometimes, when you open the door and hold it open for a minute or so - like when a couple are leaving a room gradually. It’s a function of the standard of guest staying here, but also of the hotel build that people allow their children to run around the common areas and play in the stairwell and squeal - and there is a very large internal stairwell so the sound travels, very well - especially when they play the running up and down and sqealing game. There’s little to be done about all the noise and the staff seem to work so hard and be friendly to make up for the hotel’s shortcomings.

Finally - can anything be done? Carpet isn’t practical, but perhaps under the box base beds a thick felt mat could absorb the noise. The mattresses are probably fine for Asian guests who seem to have a cultural preference for very firm/hard. But the ones that are already mildewed or are seriously worn out with the dreaded ‘hole in the middle’ hollow feeling from extensive commercial use need to replaced and it should be done with soft mattresses - available to guests with a preference for soft/padded/comfortable. The use of regular ensemble bases found in most hotels with felt pads on the feet could be adopted along with the new mattresses. As to the rest of the soundproofing issues - a technical check of the doors for low battery levels could at least minimise the pesky beeping - on average 3 times a day/any time of the day or night (that was other people on our floor) - and thankfully only once our door decided to do it.

How to cope? As with any challenges - a sleep mask, ear plugs, a sleeping pill and, ideally a strong gin and tonic. Fine every night. But highly impractical during the day when you might want to spend some quiet time in your room after a big day out exploring all Hue has to offer. So if you like a good price, a hard mattress and sleep like the dead - crack on, this is the hotel for you. If you feel like the walking dead after multiple nights of bad sleep, this hotel might not be for you. We reiterate the staff are doing everything they can - 1000% but it was like flying long haul for 4 days strapped into the middle seat of the middle row, next to the toilets. Albeit with business class food and service and wonderful staff. A real hard product / soft product dilemma. If it weren’t for the staff we would have only given 1 or at most 2 Tripadvisor bubbles - because when it comes down to it, for us, a hotel is there for sleeping - itdoesn't matter how pretty the room is, how nice the picture on the wall is or how sweet the staff are...

The hotel reception staff is very professional and extremely kind and is always smiling and will help you with whatever request you may have. I was sick during my stay and they called a doctor for me, they arranged a bus transfer to Da Nang even though I had called them quite late at night.

The hotel has its own restaurant and the employees are just amazing. They will go out of their way to make your stay as unforgettable as possible. They are also smiling all the time; they are very considerate and extremely kind indeed.

All the waitresses were outstanding, and one of them stood out even more. Her name is Selena, she seriously has a golden heart, and I can say that the restaurant is very lucky to have her, she is a gem.

One of the more kind-hearted person I have met so far during this trip. She made me feel just like home and even more. I thank you ever so much for it, you’re the best :).

Now, regarding the hotel facilities; the hotel is very clean and the rooms are spacious, neat and nicely decorated, the mattress is very comfortable and so are the pillows.
The food at the restaurant is good and will certainly fill you up. The hotel also has its own spa in the Serene Shining Hotel which is a few blocks from here, there services is excellent.

Nov 2018,"We rarely give five stars but the Serene Palace earns them easily. We much enjoyed our three night stay and really don't have much more to say. A spacious and exceptionally clean room; everything worked well - hot water, WiFi; good breakfast, real fruit juices; the usual borderline smothering solicitude from the smiley Reception staff.

Perhaps the best feature is the location. You need to be close, but maybe not too close, to the buzzing bar and restaurant district centred on the junction of Vo Thi Sau and Chu Van An which is pedestrianised at the weekends. This area is packed through the evening with tourists and locals of all ages (a sort of dressed-up Vietnamese passeggiata). Unmissable. Halloween made this even more fun for us, which seems to be quite a thing here, however culturally incongruous. But the number of live bands and street acts will make you glad you are sleeping a block or two away.

A geriatric PC in the room, presumably for browsing and email, was an unusual touch and provided a nice trip down memory lane.

The Citadel is a pleasant half-hour walk away along the river past the dragon boat wharf.",50,2,"East Anglia, United Kingdom",14,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Michael424,Michael424,October 2018,Top marks,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293926-d4357913-Reviews-or230-Hue_Serene_Palace_Hotel-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html#REVIEWS

Oct 2018,"Before going to Serene Palace earlier this year I've never really had feelings about the concept of service in the context of hotels. I couldn't really tell hotels apart on the parameter and I didn't know what service should mean. I thought of hotels as short term apartment rentals and all I expected was a key to a nice room. Other than that, I would expect to be on my own. But Serene Palace helped me to understand and appreciate hospitality.

During my 3 week trip with my family, we stayed at 6 different hotels ranging from 3 star to 5 star. Serene Palace was the cheapest, but through my 3 day stay they established themselves as the service reference that other hotels must be compared against.

When we arrived by taxi, the staff immediately rushed down to pick up our luggage. They led us into the lobby, where they immediately started to do the check-in work. No waiting. They didn't make us stand up in front of the desk, but instead encouraged us to sit at a couch setup next to the reception area where another staff member immediately served us fresh fruit.

After a quick check-in, we went to our rooms. They were clean and large rooms. Fairly standard. An unusual amenity was the presence of a (dated) internet-connected PC in the room allowing for web browsing. Helpful if you haven't brought along your own iPad or laptop. The WiFi was stable and reliable. My only complaint with the room would be the acoustics. Sound ripples through the construction, so if your neighbors are noisy, you are more likely to know than in other hotels. However, considering the cost and the other pros, I feel this is forgivable.

We've all experienced workers who sends you a negative vibe. Makes you feel unwanted and feel like they are put in their job against their will. If you consider a spectrum of staff commitment with the left side meaning total indifference and the right side being obsessive staff, this hotel is leaning towards the right side, but not to the point where it becomes creepy and/or annoying. They are attentive, but respectful.

One evening we were eating in the restaurant and my aunt didn't finish her plate. There was nothing wrong with her food, but she wasn't feeling well. The waiter noticed this and politely asked. The waiter offered her complimentary ginger tea and when we got the bill, the waiter removed the charge for my aunts food (we did not ask for a discount - she just decided to give it). That tea was just what she needed. In the morning, the staff recognised my aunt, asked if she slept well and again brought her ginger tea together with her breakfast. This gesture made us feel like our visit was (very) appreciated.

Several times during our stay, Allan in the reception would greet us on the way out or into the hotel and ask if we would like ideas on what to see or where to eat. He would listen to our concerns and ideas and provide meaningful suggestions on where to go. I know that the hotel may get commission for their recommendations, but I have no problem with that when their recommendations are great. And that was the case here. When we needed taxis, the reception would get one right away. Whenever we returned from the city to the hotel, the reception would come running to greet us and open the door.

At one point, one of us forgot the pin code for the safe. We called the reception and within minutes they were there with a master key to reset the safe. No charge for that, even though it was our own fault.

During our stay, we asked Allan in the reception about transport to Hoi An and he listened to our requirements, quickly and clearly presented us with different options and weighed in with pros and cons. Ultimately, he arranged and confirmed for us to rent a big private minibus (15 seats) for a day with stops at different landmarks/tourist attractions during the trip. And this was with 2 days notice. I think we paid around 120 USD for the service, which he put on the hotel bill. IMHO, it was a comfortable and affordable transfer to Hoi An.

In summary, the staff is great and they will help you out whenever you need it - even when you don't know that you need it.

If I go back to Hue, I would be very likely to stay here again.",50,17,NA,8,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/709nielsb,Niels B,May 2018,Exceptional value,Trip type: Traveled with family,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293926-d4357913-Reviews-or240-Hue_Serene_Palace_Hotel-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html#REVIEWS

Sep 2018,"Our stay in Hue Serene Palace was great! As you walk in, the staff makes sure to make you feel welcome, take care of your luggage and lets you relax for a few minutes while they sort the room out. During that time, they brought us a plate with different kind of fruts and offered us coffee too. The staff is very helpful and goes with you over a map of Hue and its main attractions, giving their personal advice on what to do according to your stay length. The room was great, spcious and clean. The hotel restaurant, where we ate breakfast, was also great. There is a menu with different items, to which you can order as many as you want for breakfast and they are cooked instantly.

The hotel also offered us service to rent motorbikes and do the Hai Van Pass (which goes from Hue to Danang/Hoi An). The prices were really good and motorbikes were in great conditions. The person from the motorbike service comes to the hotel, goes over important info with you, gets your phone number and take your bags which are dropped at your destination in Danang/Hoi An area (all included in the price). This was the most helpful service at Hue Serene Palace.

The location of the hotel is also good, near the bar street area yet in a thin street with no loud sounds at all. The nightly price also makes this hotel excellent value, top service for a budget!

Jul 2018,"Hue Serene Palace Hotel is your standard build Vietnamese hotel. We stayed in a 2 double bedroom and it provided sufficient room for our family over the 3 days in Hue. I got out at Hue airport and paid about 160K VND for a taxi to the airport. Make sure you have your addresses handed as driver’s may not know English well.

Whilst arriving at the hotel you feel it is off the main street and away from the action. Most of the action in this area hots up at night time. There’s currently stormwater and sewerage piping being re done so part of the street is blocked off.

When we arrived we were greeted by friendly hotel staff, welcome fruits and drinks which was really appreciated. Toiletries are basic and the hotel bathroom is respectable.

Infrastructure wise they have the standard local plugs which can fit Australian 2 pin chargers or Thailand, Taiwan or Indonesian electrical points. It won’t fit HK, Malaysia or Singapore chargers. Bottled water is provided for each person and there’s a computer in the room with chairs to sit at.

We had another double bedroom for 2 people and that was a very ample and spacious size.

In all the hotel was kept clean and worth staying at because of the location. I liked how it was not located on the walking street because once the roads are closed, you can’t drive in and out by taxi. So if you arrive or depart during the walking street time, it’s a struggle.

The only problem is sound proofing between rooms is poor and rowdy neighbours blasting a TV can mean less sleep or interrupted early mornings

Right now, the Hue Night Market isn’t really functioning and just a mere couple of stalls. What’s great is the hotel is adjacent to the Walking Street market in Vo Thi Sau, from Friday night 6pm -10pm and repeated over Saturday and Sunday. So having not been to Hue before, it was a nice surprise that we were so close to the action and the atmosphere. There’s plenty of restaurants and small stalls to buy food from and the street sellers had food that was edible for western tummies.

I also arranged a DMZ tour with the hotel and they arranged a tour guide who was a local from the area to the Vinh Moc tunnels for $100USD. Because the guide was a local who survived the war it was well worth it and more enjoyable experience. Passing the Ben Hai river was also The only thing I would completely by pass is the

I had arranged a city tour separately with another company for $50USD. I thought that was a good deal and they arranged my transfer to Da Nang, which including a stop at the super scenic Lap An lagoon and Lagoon Restaurant before the Hai Van Pass, was a good deal.",40,284,"Sydney, Australia",1920,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Goochmaster,Goochmaster,June 2018,Nice for Hue,Trip type: Traveled with family,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293926-d4357913-Reviews-or290-Hue_Serene_Palace_Hotel-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html#REVIEWS

Due to its high ranking in trip advisor reviews, we also ate tried one lunch and one dinner in the restaurant, great local and western dishes.

Hotel staff is pleasant and honest. We've never lost anything in our rooms despite stocking them with gifts (some of which are valuable) !

The staffs we were in contact with the most have text-messaged us after we had left and became our friends, that we later entrusted with taking care of our next groups of friends and family members visiting Hue.

Not too far from shops or Perfume River. And taxis will come to outside the hotel. We were unfortunate to be dropped off a coach at the wrong end of the road.

A photo of the items was included in the e-mail and asked us if these were ours. (I think the £50 note was the reason she thought the items were ours.) I confirmed the items did belong to us and that I wondered if these could be sent to us in the post. After several e-mails between us and I was told the items were too valuable to post, so I made arrangements to collect them. On arrival I was welcomed and the items returned.

May 2018,"On April 25, 2018 my wife and I checked into this hotel for 2 nights accompanied by two other couples. On arrival we found that the entire single lane street had been dug up and was a horrible mud pit! Our driver would not take his car down the street and we had to get the hotel porters to carry our luggage 50 metres to the hotel while we traipsed through the mud to the hotel lobby. Not a good start. On 27 April we checked out at 9.30 am and forgot to retrieve our Australian passports, credit cards, cash and my wife's diamond ring from our room number 402 safe. While we sat in the downstairs lobby waiting for our driver to arrive, the cleaners advised Mary, the desk manager that the safe was still locked. She despatched the bellboy with the master key. He entered the room alone at 9.54 am (before we departed at 10.00 am) and unlocked the safe. Around midday we realised we had forgotten to retrieve our passports etc. and phoned the hotel. Mary, the desk manager told us on that phone call that the safe was empty when opened by the bellboy so we returned to the hotel to file police reports etc. We now believe that the bellboy was telling the truth. In fact we strongly suspect that the theft was orchestrated by the hotel desk manager, Alan Tran who welcomed us on April 25. I was the only Caucasian present in our group of 6 and Alan was emphatic that my Asian wife and I occupy room 402. Room 402 shared a balcony on the 4th floor with room 401 where our Malaysian friends were placed. Alan also explained that Hue was very safe and that it was safe to walk around and safe to lock our valuables in the room safes. Room 402 had NO INSTRUCTIONS for setting the room safe combination so I had to ask Alan Tran to come up to the room to show me how to set the combination. My wife saw him looking under my arm pit as I set my combination and locked my money belt with passport inside the safe. Alan then remained in the room chatting with me for about 5 more minutes. He told me he was early 30's and earned US$200 per month as did his wife. They have 2 young children. According to him, a home in Hue costs US$30,000 to $40,000 and he has no chance of ever owning his own home. I spoke of Samsung's huge investments in Vietnam and he complained bitterly that they were just raping his country and sending all the profits back to Korea. He seemed to be a very bitter young man. As he left, he said he would be off work the following day but would be on the desk the next morning when we checked out. That night I opened the safe and locked up my wife's money pouch containing her passport and valuables. At the time of making my police statement, I thought I had opened the safe the next day but in fact I was upset, confused and wrong in that part of my police statement. I only opened the safe once and that was when I put my wife's pouch in the safe. The next day we were all out till mid afternoon when I returned alone for a rest. After a while I noticed the room was quite hot even though the air conditioner was turned on. I looked behind the curtains and saw that the balcony door was wide open. I thought nothing of this and closed and locked it but did mention this to my wife when she returned a few hours later. The balcony is shared with the adjoining room 401 where our friends were staying but is on the 4th floor facing the street. You would need to be spider man to climb onto it! The morning we checked out, Alan Tran was NOT working. He had phoned in and changed his shift to the evening, citing ""family matters"". Note that a CCTV camera is recording every entry to our room 24/7. We think that Alan may have passed the safe combination to one of the 4 cleaners who work as a team cleaning the rooms together. This cleaner then unlocked our balcony door on the morning of April 26 then moved with the cleaning team to the adjoining room number 401 and went out alone to clean their balcony, quickly entering our room 402 through the unlocked balcony door, opening the safe and stealing its contents then returning unseen to room 401, deliberately leaving the balcony door wide open to make it look like an outside job. This would have avoided the CCTV camera looking at the entry to room 402. A stolen Australian passport can be sold for a large sum on the black market. If it was Alan, then he got his house. I hope his children will be proud of him. When the police attended on 27th April, the desk manager Mary, accompanied by the hotel manager, acted as our interpreter both with the police in the room and then at the office of the immigration police. They both seemed very keen for us to leave town, telling us that it we would have to stay till late the next week to get a stamped and signed copy of the police report itemising our lost valuables (cash, credit cards and jewellery). The immigration police officer got angry with us and thumped the table with his hand when we tried to write the word ""stolen"" on our statement. He slapped a new form down in front of my wife and then in front of me and insisted through Mary, the hotel interpreter that we write the word ""lost"" when referring to our passports. We felt quite intimidated by him and he then left the office at 4.45 pm and we were told there was no one available to stamp and sign our statements about ""losing"" our passports. We knew by then that we needed these signed and stamped statements to be able to obtain an exit visa to leave Vietnam. We chose to leave Hue and drive back to Da Nang when Mary assured us that she would get the statements stamped and signed the next day. In fact Mary sent photos of the signed and stamped statements via whatsapp to us that evening after we arrived in Da Nang, claiming that she found another immigration office opened to sign them. The Serene Palace Hotel then sent the originals to us in Da Nang by private car the next morning at their expense. We felt that we had been manipulated into leaving Hue and that the hotel management wanted to get rid of us as soon as possible. We have never received official police copies of our report itemising the stolen valuables but did managed to take photos of the statements we wrote for the investigating police whilst seated in room 402. All up, it took 12 more days before we could leave Vietnam. We had to obtain travel documents from Vietnam Immigration to allow us to fly to Ho Chi Minh where we applied for emergency passports from the Australian Consulate, exit visas from Vietnam immigration and entry visas back to Malaysia where we had left our Australian house keys and other items in our holiday apartment in Kuala Lumpur. Furthermore I became very ill in Ho Chi Minh and was briefly hospitalised, losing 4 kg of weight by the time I recovered in time to fly out. All up, our 2 night stay at Serene Palace Hotel managed to turn our 6 day holiday into an 18 day nightmare.",10,10,"Perth, Australia",13,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/askmeaboutwa,askmeaboutwa,April 2018,Beware.

May 2018,"Don't be put off by the street (really an alley): yes, it's muddy and in terrible condition, but Serene Palace is simply an oasis! (And, apparently, the street is due to be repaired).

I don't have enough superlatives to describe this hotel!! It is immaculate, and very welcoming. They have a full bank of smiling staff to help you with anything you might need, and each and every one of them is very kind, service-oriented and speaks English very well.
Sarah, Sallie, Jack and the rest of the staff were so wonderful.

The hotel happens to be just around the corner from the prime bar and restaurant area, where they close off 5 streets to traffic every evening (a welcome reprieve from the scooters!!), and you can wander and people watch for hours.
However, despite being so close to this boisterous area, it was utterly without noise from both inside and outside the hotel, something that I only experienced here. It is also within easy walking distance from the Citadel.

After being greeted with lemonade and fresh fruit upon arrival, in the room I found real rose petals on my bed, a fridge that worked well, cable TV, a computer (!), a coffee pot and fresh fruit, a counter in the bathroom to put toiletries on (rare in Vietnam), an umbrella on the back of the door (very thoughtful!) and, for the first time, READING lights!!

There is only one thing that I would change: brighter ceiling lights in the room would be welcome.
That said, I would never consider staying anywhere else when I return to Hue. This was the best hotel I stayed in in Vietnam.

May 2018,"We stayed for two nights at the Hue Serene Palace. Originally we booked the Superior Room which is nicely and with a look for details decorated and with e.g. a computer useful equipped (especially during longer travels). However, the hotel has per floor one room (the Superior Room, Room Nr. 3) in the middle of the floor and those rooms only have windows to the hallway. From the pictures it is not clear, that the Superior Room has no real window and especially room 303 is due to the windows to the hallway (which is all the way to the dining room two floors down open) still quite noisy.

At our first night they had no other rooms free but at the next morning we explained once again the situation (no real window and really noisy) to the restaurant manager Sally and she ensured that we would get another room. With Sallys help we got for our second night the Deluxe Room without additional charge, which was really nice and also quiet. But in order to have a nice stay during both nights it would have been better if the hotel would have written us, that the Superior Room is not a quiet room (for what we precisely asked in our booking).

We could therefore recommend not to book the Superior Room but rather the Junior or Deluxe Room (at least if you want a window). The rooms with the number 1, 2, 4 and 5 are at the end of the floor and with a window and only the rooms number 3 are in the middle.

Before we booked we were a little bit worried about the comments regarding to try to sell tours to guest. In our case the ladies at the reception told us about the tours only once and when we told them, that we want to do it by ourselves it was no problem and we weren't asked again. Beside this the service at the reception is nice, and especially Sally is (as already mentioned) highly motivated and incredible friendly.

On arrival we got not only a fresh juice as welcome drinks but also a tasty fruit salad. The restaurant is in general really nice, we had the best fresh springs rolls all over Vietnam, wonderful vegan vegetable Pho and a great breakfast. On the buffet they have various fresh juices, bread, sweets etc. In addition you can order lots of things such as pancakes, eggs, soups etc.

Apr 2018,"This was an excellent value hotel with super helpful (if rather busy) staff. We booked a car and driver (Phuc) via the hotel to drive us from Hoi An to Hue which was an excellent idea. Our driver was lovely. He drove safely, the car was high quality and he took us to all the places we wanted to visit (marble mountain, Hai Van pass, Lang Co beach and the lagoon) as well as stopping at a fishing village. We had the same driver the next day to visit 3 of the emperors tombs. The hotel manager advised us to go in the morning as the majority of the tour buses do the Citadel in the morning and the tombs in the afternoon. He was so right! The first tomb was so peaceful and then it got more and more busy! The manager also booked a private dragon boat trip along the Perfume river down to the Thien Mu pagoda which was well worth a 30 min stop. The boat waited for us and then dropped us off at the Citadel on the way back. Given we only had 1 clear day in Hue that was about the right length for a boat trip and made a nice break in between pagodas and temples! Just be aware however that the boats are usually ran by a family and this is their livelihood, so while on board they will try to sell you some souvenirs and stuff, so take some small notes with you. We ate at the hotel both nights and the food was delicious, especially the banana flower salad and the set menu. No wonder it comes highly recommended on trip Advisor!

Check-in was very smooth. They gave us a welcome drink and someone from the staff sat down with us to go over the basic hotel information, surroundings, things to do and see in Hue etc. They also arranged a tour for us which turned out to be awesome.

Apr 2018,"We stayed here for 2 nights as part of a larger trip around Vietnam. I will say I had initial misgivings about the place being dropped at the top of the alleyway it's situated on, as there was fairly extensive work ongoing to pave the alley and other work going on, but once we got to the hotel everything was fine.

The hotel overall was clean and well presented. Beds were comfortable and the rooms were very clean. Breakfast which was included was varied and really good. I opted for the garlic and egg fried rice both mornings, and there were other cold and hot items to help yourself to.

The standout for the hotel is the staff, they're all so helpful and friendly, and everyone we spoke to spoke great English.

Location wise it's a short walk to the river and about a 35 min walk to the citadel.

Based on the staff and the low cost of the rooms, I'd definitely recommend if you're stopping over in Hue.",50,18,"Bristol, United Kingdom",98,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spaceboy250,Paul F,April 2018,Hotel staff are great,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293926-d4357913-Reviews-or340-Hue_Serene_Palace_Hotel-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html#REVIEWS

Apr 2018,"Was at this Hotel in April 2018. I was on a solo trip and wanted to check out the Imperial City. Based on reviews on Trip Advisor, found this hotel.

The location was great. It was close the the night life with 5 minute walk. It is a little hard to find as it is down a narrow alleyway. Absolutely safe, as you walk down the alleyway there are other hotels, hostel and restaurants and tour guide shops. The location offers a quiet and calm atmosphere and a day or so of exploring the city and sights.

The staff was extremely helpful and very nice. Rooms are clean. The bed was very comfortable. There was complimentary water inside the room. The bathroom was very clean. Hot water was not an issue. There was a free wifi. They had in-house laundry service. There was also a mini fridge and a room safe.

The breakfast was included and different options. Vietnamese and Western Style. I had both styles while I was there.

The pre-arranged pick up by the hotel bellman at the train station was like clockwork and he has been great since our stay. We locked ourselves out of the safe and he quickly came up to re-program. Julia greeted us and shared all sorts of options for tours around the city and suggested a better option to get to Hoi An in private car vs the train. She helped with getting our laundry done and it was returned the next day at a very reasonable price. We had a balcony and enjoyed sitting at the end of the day with a cool one. Breakfast included menu items such as omelettes and eggs but also Pho and rice dishes. The hotel is quiet and yet close to many restaurants.

Feb 2018,"Stayed at Hue Serene Palace Hotel with my parents in Feb 2018. It was indeed the best hotel I’ve stayed at!

We booked the hotel’s car service from Da nang airport to Hue. The driver who picked us up was very friendly, spoke very good English, very knowledgeable about the history of Vietnam. We had an excellent drive from Da nang to Hue. We had pre-arranged for the driver to stop at certain places of interest otw to Hue and the driver was very good, took us to the best stops, explained the history of the places and was very patient. Didn’t get his name though, but he deserves a rating of 12/10!

The location of the hotel is slightly off the main road, which is good. The receptionist are very friendly, speaks good English and there was welcome fruits and drinks. :)

We stayed on the 7’th floor, the room was very big, clean and has modern toilet facilities. Best thing is the room had a computer in it! Which was really amazing, even the 5* hotels in London don’t have a computer in the room! There’s also complimentary fruits given everyday.

Breakfast at the hotel is amazing. Again it beats the 5* hotels in London, Australia and etc. You can choose an array of food from the menu which taste amazing!

However, don’t opt for the tour packages offered by the hotel at the reception, it’s really very pricey and they are not really honest about prices. Do grab a taxi from the streets yourself or do your own research.

Jan 2018,"My friend and I stayed at Serene for one rushed night (flights delays etc) in January and it was very pleasant. The staff were welcoming and friendly. Our twin room was huge with two double beds and a bath tub. Amenities and breakfast were great. We also ordered a tuna salad from the restaurant, made to go, and it was really yummy.

The hotel is about a 25 minute walk or cheap cab to the Citadel entrance. The front desk can arrange anything you want. We decided to get a private car to Hoi An, arranged by the hotel which was an incredible experience. I recommended it. It was $60 for the car regardless of the amount of ppl and by the time you catch the train to Da Nang ($19) and take a take to Hoi An ($20) the car is worth the price because our driver stopped at multiple places on the way.

Would highly recommend taking a personal tour over a group one as you can time your own our pace. Hue is the old capital of Vietnam so there is lot of history in those tombs and pagodas that you will visit. Highly recommend our tour guide Mr Hue (check for him at Serene reception). Breakfast was very good too. Not a lot of options but whatever was there was just right to fill you up before you embark on your day journey. We also booked transfer to Hoi An from the hotel.

Jan 2018,"You would never choose this hotel from the outside – it’s on a muddy, crumbling street that looks like a back alley, and the front of the building doesn’t make much of an impression – but inside we found a very clean, modern and lovely hotel with excellent service at a good price.

Alan at the front desk was especially helpful with arranging travel plans and tour packages, including private tours of the Citadel, Thien Mu Pagoda, Minh Mang and Khai Dinh Tombs, as well as the DMZ and Vinh Moc tunnels. And Sally in the restaurant was incredibly sweet, bringing us food to take with us on our tours when she felt we didn’t eat enough for breakfast!

The bed was huge and comfortable, and the bathroom was large, with plenty of storage room. Towels, robes and sheets were all plush and high-quality. There was a nice jacuzzi tub but no shower – apparently the rooms have either a tub or a shower, but not both. Inside the beautiful room was a computer for guest use, as well as a refrigerator and small safe. The WiFi worked everywhere and the TV had plenty of channels, including CNN.

The hotel is also located within an easy walk to the riverfront and night market. There were plenty of good restaurants nearby, but the hotel restaurant was just as good as any of them! See separate review of the restaurant.

Jan 2018,"I had written the review once and then realised that I had been too harsh. Thus I decided to revise my review and here I am

Location - It's on a nondescript lane which has just enough space for one vehicle at a time. Not a very good first feel. Lot of eateries within a short walk. Perfume river flows close by. Reaching there was no issue as the Taxi from the Airport took us straight without any hassle

Front Desk - Efficient. All the ladies willing to help with their workable English. They guided us with whenever we asked something - be it with tourist attraction, money exchange, travel booking et al. They were also extremely helpful to connect us with our bus driver when we had got separated inside the Bach Ma National Park

Lift - Only one lift which becomes kind of rush during peak hours. Not a big deal though

Room - We had booked a family room. Spacious enough for a family of 4. Two large and comfortable beds. Very clean. A little short on furnitures Also, the balcony is of little use as it oversees the same small lane

Sleep Quality - Being off the main road, it becomes very quiet and one can enjoy a good night's sleep. The hotel can consider upgrading their pillows

Bathroom - Large bathroom with different rooms having either bath tub or shower area. Overall quite clean but there was some room for improvement

Breakfast - Limited Menu. Only Breads and fruits on the spread. Rest made to order. This can be a hassle during rush hours but the food is served hot and it is very tasty. We really enjoyed the noodle soup and seafood fried rice. Eggs were made to order

Restaurant - Small restaurant at the lobby level - same place where breakfast is served. Though they boasted of 1-for-1 cocktails, the cocktail maker can do with some training. The restaurant closes at 10 PM

Travel Desk - They provide all kinds of travel arrangement. We decided quite late on the tour to Bach Ma National park and they could still arrange that for the next day morning. They can even book the train tickets (albeit for a small premium). However, we chose to book our tickets from the station. The girls at the travel desk and reception were ever willing to help. At one point I thought that they were over insistent on selling their travel packages (city tour, river cruise etc) rather than paying attention to what we wanted - but perhaps that was because of the language issue - persistent all through Vietnam.

Laundry - The hotel laundry has a fantastic rate of USD2 per Kg and returns within 12 hours. I have never got such a good price in any hotel

Overall - A small hotel with a lot of personal touch put in by the staff. A little pricey in my case when I compared my stay in Danang.",40,98,"Singapore, Singapore",166,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abaner,abaner,December 2017,Nice Stay,Trip type: Traveled with family,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293926-d4357913-Reviews-or430-Hue_Serene_Palace_Hotel-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html#REVIEWS

Our first morning there we were unable to eat the breakfast because of an early morning tour, but the staff was gracious enough to pack a “to go box” for my family, which was definitely appreciated.
The hotel is situated conveniently to the city center which makes walking to the pedestrian zone easy and quick, while keeping a majority of the night life noise out of hearing distance.

The room was large and well appointed - bed, bathroom - all comfortable, clean, in working order. Also, quiet room as the hotel is in a small alley. Why only 4 stars? Because the hotel has the charm of an airport holiday inn. This was not helped by the fact that we came and left under pouring rain. Very depressing weather.

Nov 2017,"Wow. The service in this hotel rivals five-star hotel service! Staff were excellent from check-in to checkout, giving map, recommendations, and arranging everything for us to make our stay comfortable and enjoyable. Even if the weather didn't cooperate with us (it was rainy when we were in Hue), we still enjoyed our stay because of the staff!

Car Service: We arranged for two-way car service from and to the airport ahead of time. Emailed the staff our arrival and departure details and everything was arranged in time. One-way car service is $15 and roundtrip is $30, so there's no reason not to get it.

Check-in: Check-in was done seamlessly with welcome fruits and drinks. Maps were provided and a 10% discount coupon on their restaurant was given to us for lunch and dinner (which is the #2 Best Restaurant in Hue!)

Room: Room we booked was at the top floor with a balcony at only $48 which already included breakfast! It has a great view of Hue and the room was spacious with thoughtful Vietnamese art and decor. There's also a private desktop computer in the room, which was very helpful for checking in with our next flight. Bathroom is spacious with adequate amenities and warm water for shower. There's a bidet in the toilet, which is one of the things we wish all hotels would have. There's a welcome fruits and small bottle of wine waiting for us in the room.

Checkout: Checkout was fast and the staff at the restaurant gave us a parting gift of food to take to the airport!

Service: Staff service is most commendable. All staff were great from the receptionist to the wait staff in the restaurant.

Breakfast: Small buffet spread of pastries and coffee plus you can choose any from their breakfast menu. We were so stuffed. A must-try is their Bun bo Hue which is the noodle soup specialty in Hue (better than Pho, I must add.)",50,181,"Louisville, Kentucky",187,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danielzky,danielzky,November 2017,Best Hotel in Hue!,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293926-d4357913-Reviews-or480-Hue_Serene_Palace_Hotel-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html#REVIEWS

The real stars of the hotel however are the staff. All very friendly and helpful. Special thanks to Jack the bell-boy who came to meet us at the train station and to Si on reception who was so helpful with suggestions on Hue and assisted in our onward travel planning in Vietnam. Of course a big mention to Sally and her team in the dining room. Everyone was so friendly and the breakfasts were wonderful. There is a buffet section and also a choice from the menu if you'd like eggs, Pho, or pancakes etc. I tried them all over the course of our visit and all were beautifully prepared.

Oct 2017,"Pros:
1. All the staff made an effort to talk and assist you, whether is it the bellboys, front desk attendants or waitresses in the restaurant. It makes the stay a truly homely one.
2. Room is rather spacious with basic necessities.
3. Breakfast was sumptuous and all you can eat from the menu. Love the wide range of fruits.
4. 1-1 drinks are really value for money.
5. Complimentary fruits everyday, ready in room.

Cons:
1. Located in the back alley. Bigger cars are unable to drive in and drop you off.
2. Additional roll-out bed and pillows are not so comfortable.
3. Trip arrangement by hotel seems a little on the pricier side.

Sep 2017,"I can't really fault this hotel at all, we had a deluxe city view room, it had a big balcony. the room was quite large, and plenty of room in the bathroom with a big shower, (careful it can get slippery).

The breakfast was wonderful, they had the basics such as fruit, bread, juice, cakes etc. laid out buffet style and you order eggs, bacon etc.

The location of hotel is down a small alleyway, but don't let this put you off, come out of hotel and turn left walk down to end of alley and then turn right and you are right in the thick of it, and in the new Walking Street area, heaps of fantastic restaurants and shops. Close to river you can wander down to the night markets etc in just a few minutes.

What makes this hotel stand out so much is the staff, WOW they are the friendliest, happiest bunch, they greet you buy your first name and go above and beyond to help you in every way they can, even if the room was average and it certainly wasn't this place would get a 5 just for the staff alone.

The staff are exceptionally helpful and were able to book us in for a nice tour going around all of the main attractions of Hue at a fair price. We stayed 3 nights and found the rooms to be clean and tidy, with the staff super courtious and friendly (especially everyone at the main reception desk and the lovely pregnant lady from the restaurant).

Reasoning behind the 4 stars is due to the AC in our room not working after several hours of it running. We went down to reception at that night, and the doorman came up and had a look at it for us. He agreed that it wasn't working after playing with the remote for 5 minutes, and left (we assumed to check for another room). He never came back! Went down to the reception again after packing our bags and they switched us to another room. New room was nice but we only were able to stay in it for one night, before we had to switch back to our existing one. Fortunately the AC was fixed for that night (It is super humid in Hue).

Sep 2017,"If you are looking for a great value hotel in Hue, look no further that the Serene Palace.

First and foremost, the service here is second to none. We spent 2 weeks in Vietnam in a number of hotels, and the service we received here from all of the staff was head and shoulders above - in a country with such outstanding service I hope this is the greatest compliment I can give! The staff seem genuinely interested in helping you make the most out of your stay, and will do whatever they can to be of assistance.
Communication is great - we emailed in advance and were offered a room upgrade, and replies were very prompt. The airport shuttle service was superb and efficient, with a very friendly driver and a comfortable car, complete with travel guides on the back seats! A nice touch.
The location is great - a little tricky to find down a narrow alley, but just a short walk to the central area of Hue and the main restaurants and bars.
The hotel lobby is very typical of Vietnam - meticulously clean and spacious. The room itself was very large and well presented, with nice touches such as rose petals on the bed. There was complimentary food and bottled water each day. The only comments for improvements that I would make for the rooms are to include an option for a standing shower, and also to have double beds and duvets for double rooms - our bed was two singles pushed together, complete with two single duvets! Not much of an issue but worth mentioning.
Breakfast was good - lots of choice as well as being able to order whatever you liked fresh from the menu, from eggs to pancakes.
The restaurant itself was also great in the evenings, and a perfect option if you are tired from a long day and don't want to leave the hotel.

The only drawbacks I would mention is that the air conditioning is not very strong and given the heat in Hue (compared to Saigon), it was a little uncomfortable for us. Hue is also a much smaller city so there is no Uber or Grab and it was very difficult to get a taxi (we only use the Mai Linh of Vinasun companies) when going around town. However, when leaving from the hotel, the staff can always call a taxi for you. They also arranged for a car to drive us down to Hoi An. It cost about $65USD and we could take as long as we wanted on the journey so we could stop by some beautiful places like Lang Co beach, Hai Van Pass, and Marble Mountain. The driver was great, professional, and friendly. Overall, we would recommend this hotel. Breakfast was okay. But really, the standout factor was the staff - we loved talking to them and teaching them to play ukelele!

We were on the 6th floor and had a supper room with a balcony (however at this time of year it is too hot to sit out)
Large bathrooms too - some bedrooms only have a large shower and others have a bath with a shower in it - so do specify which you would prefer.
Breakfast is a treat - eggs anyway you want and perfectly cooked - lots of fresh fruits and lovely baguette bread.
Reception and dining staff were very pleasant and helpful
Great location - down a well lit alleyway - plenty of other small hotels here too.

From even before you arrive the staff make you feel extremely welcome - they organised a taxi to pick us up from the train station after a rather sleepless night train and made sure our room was ready early so we could check in straight away.

The staff could not have been more helpful in showing/suggesting where we should eat, visit and arranging our onward travel to Hoi An.

The rooms themselves are very spacious and new, very clean and importantly the strongest air conditioning we've had yet. The included breakfast was excellent - pho and banana pancakes with ice coffee plus a large range of other choices.

The staff is friendly and helpful, trying to accomodate every wish and one staff member even volunteered to accompany me to a store to make sure I would find it and to overcome possible language barriers! Wonderful.

We were a tad concerned about the noise because there was a bar with loud live music on our first night (Friday), but they stopped at 22 pm and the rest of the stay we slept with open balcony doors! The small street were the hotel is located is safe 100% and very quiet.

The room we had was spacious, fresh fruit was provided daily and the room was always very clear! The wood floors and the somewhat thin walls do not help with noise cancellation so depending on how considerate your room neighbours are, you might hear one thing or another, but it was never really bothersome.

The private tours (one to the Paradise Cave, one to citadel, tombs and pagoda) were all great, everybody always friendly and on time.

Apr 2017,"Stayed here for three nights with our two girls, aged 12 and 9. The room was very comfortable and although the bathroom could have benefitted from a little updating, it was clean and the shower (mixer over a bath) provided lots of high pressure hot water. The hotel was very helpful in arranging trips (our favourite was the boat trip down the perfume river to the pagoda, and then back to the citadel) and prices were very reasonable. The hotel restaurant is on the ground floor by the lobby, and although it's not enormously luxurious, the food was decent (offering both Vietnamese and Western) and excellent value. Can't fault the service throughout the hotel.

Apr 2017,"Booked this hotel with Agoda after reading the good reviews on TA, for my two night stop off on my travels.

Arranged a transfer with the hotel and the driver was waiting for me with a board with my name on it.

When we turned down a small lane with backpacker hostels and tour operators I began to wonder what I had booked but I need not have worried. The hotel entrance was lovely with a water feature and open through to the restaurant. Check in was quick and I was taken to my room which was quite big, good a/c, flat screen tv with plenty of channels and a laptop. Bed comfy but slightly hard. Also a set of scales was provided in the room which I thought was very thoughtful for weighing cases before leaving. Tea & coffee and a plate of fruit provided.

I had dinner in the hotel and it was very nice. Breakfast was good, not too much choice but eggs were cooked to order.

Staff were very helpful and friendly and gave me a map and told me where everything was. The receptionist arranged a trip up the perfume river to the pagoda for me and asked how I enjoyed it when I got back.

Quite close to shops and bars/restaurants, about a 20 minute walk.

Apr 2017,"This was a really modern and lovely hotel and the staff were so helpful and friendly and always extremely cheerful. The room was huge, comfortable, and had a balcony. The breakfast was excellent (a la carte, plus a fruit buffet) with a range of Vietnamese food and also some western options. I think we paid about $45 for our room which seems excellent value. I read a couple of reviews on Tripadvisor cautioning that the hotel was located down a 'dodgy' alley way -- you can safely ignore such descriptions as these minor lanes are quite common in cities in Vietnam and not at all 'dodgy'. This particular lane also has a great cocktail garden bar, right next door to the hotel (called The Secret Lounge). I only have one negative comment on the Hue Serene Palace Hotel, which is that the airy rooms with timber floors do come with the cost of a bit of noise. You can hear doors, footsteps and voices from the other rooms and the hallway. It's not a major problem and easily solved with a pair of earplugs for sleeping, but it could be a dealbreaker if you are sensitive to noise.

Mar 2017,"During our 3 weeks in Viet Nam, we stayed at several hotels and saw a wide variety of rooms because we were in a group. The Hue Serene Palace Hotel ranked as the best hotel we stayed at in Viet Nam by far. We wished that we could take it with us to all of our other Vietnamese destinations. For starters, they welcomed us with delicious juices. The elevator made getting up and down super easy, especially during check in/out with our luggage. The staff was amazing throughout our stay. They always made sure that we were comfortable and taken care of. The rooms are immaculate, and the beds were very comfortable.

The daily breakfast had a good variety as part of the buffet, and beyond that, as part of the included breakfast, you're able to order from the menu to get hot items too. We had dinner at the restaurant one night because we were too lazy to go out, and it was quite good, though a little pricier than the local restaurants.

Speaking of, the hotel was in a very good location close to some great restaurants, most notably Hanh Restaurant, which served a great prixe fixe menu that gives you a sampling of local Hue foods, and an unmarked oc (snail) restaurant on Ba Trieu. For the oc restaurant, just look for a commercial-looking restaurant (A Mo Quan on 04 Ba Trieu) with lots of big colorful food signs along the right-hand wall and DON'T go there; go to the divey one that is next to it to the left. Just ask the owner what you should eat.

The hotel also provides laundry service, and there was another (cheaper) laundry service just down the street too if you're willing to deal with the slight inconvenience of taking laundry out of the hotel.

Again, we cannot speak highly enough of the Hue Serene Palace Hotel. Wonderful!

Although it rained the entire time we were in Hue' and we couldn't make use of the balcony, it was still nice to have that extra space. Breakfast in the Serene Palace restaurant was fantastic, eggs and pho' cooked to order, and a nice continental buffet. The restaurant was also a perfect spot to have dinner, the food was fantastic. I can see why it is rated the no. 1 restaurant in Hue'. But the defining feature of this hotel is the staff. Ms Jenny, Ms Kelly and Ms Scarlett could not do enough for us. They were incredibly friendly, helpful and just so nice. They greeted us like old friends after a day of sightseeing, and always offered to assist in any way they could. The entire staff were always genuinely interested in how our day was going, and other places we were visiting on our honeymoon. They were very efficient in booking private cars, and they certainly helped us in navigating the Citadel. I will be recommending this hotel to anyone who visits Hue'.

Service staff especially Jenny were very helpful in planning our very short stay, we settled for a day tour across Hue Citadel and tombs. Breakfast was great, especially the bread. Whenever we head back to the hotel they would always speak to us, ask about comments for improvement, very ready to ensure we are well and good under their eyes.

We had booked a basic room and, after reading the other reviews, had asked for a quiet room as high as possible. We were upgraded to the top floor and a beautiful room.
There were none of the issues of other reviews - the bedding was clean, the bathroom perfect and the room immaculate. The only slightly odd thing was being asked to sign a form - just standard boilerplate - before we checked in. I imagine it's all included in the booking terms and conditions, so I found it unnecessary.
The staff were super-helpful and gracious; though we had booked out after only one day, they looked after our bags while we spent the day sightseeing and even let us use a shower when we came back - and sit in the air-conditioned lobby until it was time to go.

Oct 2016,"Serene Palace was a good mid-range hotel in Hue in a very central location. We had a great room with a balcony overlooking the city. The bed was one of the more comfortable bed’s we’ve had along our travels in Vietnam. The room itself was spacious enough for two and generally pretty good quality. The bathroom wasn’t great and the shower was a bit average always going hot, cold, warm.
The staff were great, very sweet and spoke excellent english. Breakfast was decent and we also ate dinner one night at the hotel and it was a really nice meal.

Sep 2016,"After a reasonably uncomfortable overnight trip on the train from Hanoi we arrived, tired, sore and hot in Hue but a short car ride from the Station was a little piece of heaven called the Serene Palace Hotel..
If you are not a good train traveler my tip is to fly to Hue rather than take the train. Both John and I love train travel and although it was less comfortable than others we have taken we still enjoyed it.
Any how back to the Serene Palace Hotel which again was conveniently placed in the heart of the city and again was surrounded by interesting local lanes and streets filled with Restaurants, Bars and great shopping.
This hotel is another boutique hotel of around 30 rooms and is well equipped with a good dining room, Bar and well appointed rooms.
The Serene Palace appears to be a new property in very good condition and the rooms and bathrooms were comfortable, large and well decorated.
The winning formula of this Hotel and its greatest Asset is the staff. From the very beginning the ease of the check in, welcome dink, ice cold face-washers and friendliness of the staff was both surprising and appreciated.
Breakfast in the restaurant was fresh, ample, suitable for travelers from all over the world with not only the buffet but a wide choice of cooked products.
We also Dined in the Restaurant at night and was surprised by the quality, presentation of the food and how extensive the menu was. ( if you do dine here ask for the Royal Spring Rolls and wait to be amazed by the dish you get ) We discovered that this Restaurant is No.1 on Trip Advisor's list for the City of Hue and we think this is well deserved
Here again the ability of the staff to speak English blew us all away and so I asked one of the young girls how they learned this skill. Her reply was that she learned it as part of a Hospitality and hotel course at University so it shows how determined Vietnam is to improve its image as a destination for Tourism.

Sep 2016,"We booked this hotel before coming to Vietnam and we booked 5 nights, which we did not realise is far too long for Hue. My recommendation is that you only need 2 or 3 nights depending on arrival and departure times.
Our room is clean, tidy and well looked after. The thing that lets the room down is the bathroom. The bedroom is bright, spacious and modern and then you walk into a dingy little run-down bathroom. The ceiling tiles are stained and so is the bath. The shower is the worst we've had for hotels of a similar price - the shower head is too low down for taller people and it is quite weak. The little bottles of shower gel and shampoo are clearly refilled rather than replaced which seems a bit cheap since the labels on them have worn off making it difficult to work out which is which. The other negative about the room would be the tacky, plastic, sunflower bins. These don't really fit the style of the room and so they look out of place. Other than this the room is lovely but the bathroom lets it down.
Another thing would be the level of noise in this hotel. Every morning at 5am we were awoken to loud banging, slamming of doors, scraping of furniture, etc. We noticed that some rooms are being painted so we assume that it was staff but perhaps it was guests. The walls and floors are quite thin so you can hear your neighbours sometimes anyway. Either way we did not appreciate being woken this early every day.
Location is perfect. Right in the heart of the old town. Plenty of good restaurants nearby and within walking distance of the citadel. Plus taxis in this area are cheap if you don't want to walk to dinner.
The hotel restaurant is rated as the best in Hue and we can see why. Service is fantastic and the food is lovely too. There is a huge selection to choose from and we tried many dishes during our stay, all of which were delicious. If you stay here you have to try the restaurant! The breakfast was also good with the same service.
The general service of the hotel staff was good. Everyone was friendly and they helped us arrange some private cars and did some laundry for us which is a good price. The one negative would be that the first information we received on Hue and the attractions was rather limited unbeknownst to us. When we went to ask for some specific information the 2nd day, after we had visited the citadel. The lady informed us about the combination ticket for this and the royal tombs which would have saved us a significant amount of money. This was a little disappointing and we just paid individually in the end.
I can understand why this hotel is rated so well. It is fantastic value for money but we have stayed in some other hotels in Vietnam which have the same nightly rate and they are slightly better. The room, restaurant, location, and service here are all generally good. It was just the few things mentioned above which let it down for us.",30,16,NA,51,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharlotteDoddy,CharlotteDoddy,September 2016,Good and bad,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293926-d4357913-Reviews-or870-Hue_Serene_Palace_Hotel-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html#REVIEWS

They called a driver and one of the receptionists accompanied us throughout the whole evening for translation and did everything to help us.
Every morning they prepared some food for my friend in the hospital and asked if they could help us. They even lowered the price of our hotel room a little bit and gave us one day for free, just as little support!

Aug 2016,"For what we paid for, Serene Palace was certainly head and shoulder above its class. Although it was located on a side street, there was no issue walking in and out to where we wanted to go. Well located to move around in the city with ease. Hotel room is big, clean, comfortable, good air-con under the hot weather and most of all, friendly service from door man to reception to the service staff in the restaurant.

Hearty breakfast selection from the menu which also included local food like Pho. The egg omelette with the stuffing was really tasty and yummy!

Aug 2016,"The hotel was able to arrange a late pick up from the airport with one of their drivers. Ride was about 20 mins or so. Most hotels and hostels in Hue are located in alleys, the Serene Palace Hotel no different. There are signs at the ends of the alley to help navigate, though I did miss the sign a few times. On our second day, one of the front desk staff approached us at breakfast and asked us when we arrived and said she was worried that we'd get lost because we never got a map of the area. Seems like they take their customer service seriously and I appreciate that she approached us to make sure that we got the same treatment as guests she had previously greeted. The beds are extremely comfortable! And the room is very clean. There is seasonal fruit left in your room each day. We got green bananas and passion fruit, both were perfectly ripe and sweet!! There is even an umbrella in the room for your use. 5 stars for the room and staff!

The buffet was ok. The fresh fruit and juices and bread are self serve and you order your main items off the menu with the waitress. I like this idea because it leaves much less food waste at the end of a buffet. On the menu there are some Vietnamese soups, eggs+bacon/sausage, pancakes among other options. The fried rice with garlic and egg is recommended but I think you can eat outside of the hotel for other meals.",40,69,"Daegu, South Korea",127,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ladylene,Arlene C,August 2016,"Kind staff, comfy beds",Trip type: Traveled with friends,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293926-d4357913-Reviews-or890-Hue_Serene_Palace_Hotel-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html#REVIEWS

It's a spacious, luxurious and clean hotel with super friendly staff (they brought us some free bites, drinks and cold towels when we arrived) that helped us a lot with getting around in Hue. Most of them speak excellent English, so that helps.

The rooms have the same characteristics as the hotel: spacious, luxurious and clean. We almost felt bad being in the city that much and not in the room.

For the price you pay, this hotel cannot be beaten. You get a lot of value for your money. Plus, the hotel has a great restaurant to boot (#1 on TripAdvisor).

The only bad thing I can say is that the view of some of the rooms (including ours) was not very nice; there was a wall just outside our room with a dirty airco unit placed against it. Didn't matter that much though, since we were out and about most of the time anyway.

The staff were excellent. Very attentive and friendly and took care to acknowledge the kids. The tour desk and reception did their job very well and were very efficient and friendly.

Jul 2016,"We spent one night in Hue at this hotel.

Location is on a side road right next to a Karaoke Lounge...

We checked in around 11:30pm and the karaoke lounge was in full swing... Our spacious & comfortable room seemed to be on the karaoke lounge side, so the loud music kept us awake until about 2 am...

The room itself was very clean and spacious. The bathroom was modern with all necessary amenities and very clean.

The breakfast of all you can eat off the menu was ok... The local food tastier than the western menu.

The staff are Super friendly and helpful. Even though we had checked out at 8am, they stored our luggage while we toured the charming city and attractions of Hue. When we returned hot and sweaty, they allowed us to use their facilities to shower & freshen up. Which was very kind and thoughtful!

Apart from the loud music, stay was good. Suggest when booking room, make sure you request a room far from karaoke lounge!

Jul 2016,"We got a free tomato salad starter here which was very nice.

We ordered the bacon burger and the spaghetti bolognese. Both were excellent.

We both had the chocolate mousse which was also very good. Cold, ice-cream-like. Very different to what we are used to but very well-prepared!

For drinks we had a big bottle of water to share.

The total bill was 294.000 dong, so we rounded it up to 300.000. This small tip was definitely worth it because they offered us a 10 percent discount coupon for our next visit. PLUS 2 coupons for a free cocktail when bought one for another place (which they probably own).

I know it's all business but better this than nothing. Staff was friendly, food was very good and not at all expensive for a restaurant like this.

I know a comparison is not so representative but just for fun:

Bacon burger: 8 €
Spaghetti: 12 €

Jul 2016,"We stayed in this hotel's sister establishments in both Hanoi and Hoi An (also rated at 3 stars) and this was definitely the worst of the three. That's not to say it was bad, just a bit of a let down after the other two. We stayed our first night in a family room, at the front of the hotel on the 2nd floor, but there was too much noise from both the karaoke bar next door and from the street. The hotel kindly moved us into two separate rooms on the 6th floor for no extra charge, so top marks for this. The rooms were fine, although the air conditioning in one really struggled to keep the room cool (it was noticeably hotter than the other room, despite being the same size).

Breakfast was ok (but again not as good as the other hotels in this chain) and we didn't mind the location in the narrow laneway - we never felt unsafe and it was pretty well located in the main part of town. We had a bit of a bad end to our stay when the hotel advised us that we'd only need to leave 1.5 hours before our flight and then booked the car for 7pm instead of 7am - we just made our flight.

Jun 2016,"This is a very good quality budget hotel with excellent service and a great restaurant. It's a 10 minute walk from the riverside and 10 minutes by taxi to the citadel.

We stayed in a ""serene"" room which was extremely spacious and nicely decorated and which had a balcony on the 7th floor with great views over the town. The bathroom was a bit utilitarian compared to the room decor but not a big deal considering the price. The room was actually a lot nicer than I expected for the price so no problem. It was also well kitted out - king size bed, chairs and table in room and chairs on balcony, safe, computer, mini bar, TV etc. There was nothing lacking.

The staff couldn't do enough for us and were extremely helpful. They went out of their way to help with some belongings we forgot at the hotel, putting it on a bus to Hoi An where we were staying for us to collect - all free of charge. Great service!

The hotel restaurant is ranked No 1 on Tripadvisor. We ate there a couple of times and the food was pretty good. You can also get room service. Breakfast was fruit and bread self-service and a large selection of cooked items to order from the menu.

Another plus is laundry at $2 per kilo which is a bit more than outside (which is understandable) but significantly less than the per item charges at most hotels.

My husband had a massage at their sister hotel and said it was the best and the cheapest he had in Vietnam!

Overall an excellent choice, and really good value.",50,255,"Vienna, Austria",652,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveller1968,traveller1968,May 2016,Excellent budget hotel,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293926-d4357913-Reviews-or960-Hue_Serene_Palace_Hotel-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html#REVIEWS

Staff amazing. Restaurant good. Value for the money excellent. Location pretty good. The only complaint is that if you want to sleep in, when kids start yelling in the hallway, even it it's at a lower level, it echos throughout the floors, it's an open stairwell. This is common.

We had a balcony and they kindly brought up two chairs when we requested seating. The hotel is in a narrow back lane and this made it interesting seeing more of the life of the locals.

Staff told us about a fantastic local restaurant serving the Hue specialty of barbecue pork and broken rice. we went there several times. Also had the green beans with garlic - delicious and cheap food. It's called Thanh Na Restaurant - in the next street parallel to the hotel.
The hotel's included breakfast was fine too and their wifi is secure and reliable. At short notice they organised for a very good and careful driver to take us to the Thien Mu Pagoda and the Khai Dinh and Minh Mang tombs for an afternoon - it was fascinating to see the different styles of each tomb and then wonderful to get back into the airconditioned car between sorties. We had taken a taxi from the hotel to see the Citadel in the morning. You can do it easily by yourself and don't need a guide as there's plenty of information once you get in there and it's really worthwhile to visit.

May 2016,My partner and I both really enjoyed our stay here. The staff are friendly and helpful giving good advice and tips on what to do. They helped with phone calls and booking a taxi to the airport for a reasonable price. The breakfast is good and they're happy to give you seconds if you want it. The hotel is clean and tidy with a welcome drink and fruit plate on arrival. The room was spacious and clean and was services everyday. It's in a good location too as its not too far to walk into town with plenty of places en route to eat and drink. The citadel is across the river from here and is about 30 minutes walking but it's a pleasant walk and worth it. Lots of shops and stalls to have a look at nearby as well.

May 2016,"Shortly after booking the stay we received an email from the hotel offering to arrange a taxi ride from the train station for $4. This may have been slightly higher than the market rate, but it was worth not having to try to figure out transportation on arrival.

We arrived early, so the room was not ready yet, but during our 30 minute wait the staff brought us a delicious fruit plate and gave us a quick run-down on what to do around the city. We decided to hire a car for the afternoon to go to the citadel, the tombs, and the pagoda ($40).

The staff then showed us to our room which they had upgraded from Superior to City View at no extra charge. The room was very nice with faux-wood floors, clean bedding, and complimentary fruit and water. The air conditioner worked great, and the hot water was searing hot--so be careful about just jumping into the shower! The room had a view over the entire city.

After the tour, we decided to eat dinner at the hotel's restaurant. Again, the staff was extremely professional and helpful the entire time, and dinner was somewhat expensive ($20 for 2 people) but delicious. The included breakfast the next morning was also delicious with exotic fresh fruit and both western and local hot dishes.

As far as negatives go, there were only a few: this hotel is somewhat hidden away in a back alley and is not in the middle of everything. The prices are slightly higher than most of the rest of the area (but they make up for the higher prices with outstanding service). This is another hotel that requires you to turn off electricity to your room while you're away and let your room get hot and humid (though this is standard practice in Vietnamese hotels, changing that one feature would make any room worth at least a few dollars a night more).

Overall, this hotel is wonderful and I would stay here again.",50,2,NA,28,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caribbeanw2016,Caribbean W,May 2016,Friendly and Professional Hidden Gem in Hue,Trip type: Traveled with family,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293926-d4357913-Reviews-or980-Hue_Serene_Palace_Hotel-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html#REVIEWS

Apr 2016,"Stayed for 5 nights in April 2016 as a couple

Pros:
- Outstanding Customer Service
- Great Value for Money
- Large, Clean, Comfortable Rooms
- Excellent WiFi

Cons:
- Location can be off-putting at first
- Single elevator can mean long waits (it's only 7 floors or so, stairs aren't a big issue)

It's very hard to find something wrong with the Serene Palace. From the moment we booked the staff was working hard to make our stay as enjoyable as possible. When we first booked, a hotel staff member emailed us within a few minutes to see if there was anything they could do to make our stay more enjoyable, and to arrange transportation.
We arranged an airport pickup, and the driver was there with a sign and a clean modern car.

The saying ""don't judge a book by it's cover"" is perhaps never more applicable than when arriving at the Hue Serene Palace. We were a bit skeptical as the driver pulled into a small narrow alleyway. But fear not, to our surprise the entrance was clean and modern and we were greeted by 2 bellboys. The hotel staff then asked us to sit down and arranged our check-in while more staff brought us cold juice and fruit. Check-in was quick and efficient and we were soon brought to our room.

Rooms: The rooms are huge, even by western standards. The rooms have a large comfortable bed, seating area, ours even had a small balcony perfect to enjoy a coffee on after a long day of exploring. The AC worked well and quickly cooled down the rooms. Shower had high pressure and hot water. The wifi worked very well. The TV worked great and had a selection of western channels. The one oddity was that the rooms utilize an actual key (something I haven't seen in awhile in a hotel), instead of keycards. It isn't a problem at all, just an observation. The rooms were quiet and we never heard other guests. Rooms were cleaned daily by an incredibly kind and responsive housekeeping staff. The rooms also had a computer, which was handy to write emails back home and for checking out tours and attractions. The rooms are nearly apartment sized, and come with nearly everything you could need.

Breakfast: While I have separately reviewed the restaurant (we ate there many times) the included breakfast is really good. Service is impeccable and the staff is incredible responsive. They have typical western as well as Vietnamese options. There are also smoothie and other beverage options. It isn't a buffet style but instead a menu, and the staff want to make sure you're full and satisfied. There were numerous bread and fruit options.

Location and Property: As other reviewers have mentioned the hotel is located in an alley, which is off-putting at first. However, once you explore a little you realize the alley is only about 100 meters long, and is quite busy. The alley is also fairly well lit, and we never felt unsafe. The property itself is well-maintained and clean. The only issue I had was with the elevator, there is only 1 and at peak times (in the AM) it can be busy. That being said the hotel is only 7 floors, so it isn't the biggest pain to climb the stairs, but if you've got mobility issues it could be a problem.

The hotel is centrally located. The backpackers/bar district is about 5 minutes away on foot. The Citadel is about a 10 minute drive (35 minute walk). There is a night market about 15 minutes away on foot that sells souvenirs and has a few restaurants. Location is very central for exploring everything Hue has to offer.

Staff: The staff here are the real standout. Everyone was genuinely concerned that we enjoyed every aspect of our stay. The staff was among the kindest people we met in Vietnam. Jenny and Sally were both amazing and went above and beyond to ensure we enjoyed our time. Staff all spoke great English, and seemed genuinely interested in our enjoyment and also what we thought of Vietnam and Hue. They took pride in their hotel and their jobs, and this translated into a fantastic experience. The staff here provided better service than any I've ever had.

Conclusion: Don't let the alley way affect your decision, this is a fantastic choice and truly deserving of a 5 star rating. Amazing value for money.

Room and Hotel Tips:
- If you're planning on doing laundry while visiting Vietnam I'd suggest getting it done here. The cost was very reasonable (2USD per kilo) and they did a great job, they did not damage, lose, or shrink any of my clothes.
- We organized multiple excursions through the hotel and were satisfied with each one. We did the following:
- Private car to the beach (Beach Bar) (US $28)
- Private car to Minh Manh and Khai Dinh tomb, and the pagoda (US $32)
- Private car to Hoi An (US $60)
- While other agencies will offer tours for a lower price, we weren't sure if they would be trustworthy or if the cars would be modern or shared. We stuck with the hotel and we always had modern safe cars and the drivers were quite punctual. I'd highly recommend booking transport with the hotel.

Apr 2016,"During a two-week backpacking journey from northern Vietnam to central, Hue Serene Palace was probably the best value and our favorite hotel.

Honestly, as our cab pulled into the tiny alley that the hotel is located on, we were a bit skeptical. Even upon entering the lobby, which was empty at the time of our arrival, we were a bit hesitant. But from the moment we sat down, we were sold.

We were greeted with juice and fruit and told our room would be ready shortly. During that time one of the receptionists (whose English was great), provided us with a map of Hue and showed us what we could do in a day.

We stayed one night in a twin room. The room was clean, spacious, and comfortable. The beds were comfortable and clean, the bathroom was clean and spacious, and there was a desktop computer hooked up to the internet for use. We noticed that the tv in our room was also equipped with Chromecast, which was pretty awesome. We were able to hook up our music to the tv and relax.

The hotel is only a 10-minute cab ride from the Hue train station, a 30-minute walk from the Imperial City, maybe 10-15 minutes from the night market/river, and very near the bar street.

The restaurant downstairs at the hotel is also excellent and very well-priced. Breakfast was included in our room fee. The breakfast menu includes both local and Western options. I had the crepes, which weren't bad and my friend had the chicken pho, which was pretty good. There is also a fruit buffet. We opted to also eat at the restaurant for dinner and were very pleasantly surprised. Hotel patrons get a 10% discount at the restaurant.

Overall, I would definitely recommend Hue Serene Palace.

Apr 2016,"When sitting in a transfer and you drive up a narrow alley that looks like it's leading to a dodgy zone- don't be afraid! You're led to a lovely hotel with bell boys and staff at your every disposal.
They were kind, courteous. Fruit and juice upon arrival, and quick to prepare our room when they'd learnt we had been on an overnight train. Sat down to explain your options and guides. Took all luggage to our room.
Restaurant on site is helpful- especially when a thunder storm blows through town. Food is hearty and tasty.
Our private tour organised by the hotel (40usd pp) was good- although suffice to say if you're a larger person you will potentially be insulted.
I spent a good 30 mins over the 6hr tour being insulted by the guide. Telling me that it's not healthy to be fat, I should be vegetarian, I cannot be married as no man wants me if I'm fat.
Now little does she know, (even though I tried to explain ) that 80% of diet is vegetarian and I exercise all the time. Later in the tour when she looks tired and bored- she asked if I was tired, that I may drop dead! After explaining that I work a very physical 12-14hr day in London every day- she shut up and kept her thoughts to herself.
The information and lunch was very helpful, and I did enjoy it. Just not the additional comments.

Apr 2016,"My friend and I did a two week tour of north and central Vietnam, and the Hue Serene Palace was our favorite hotel. The rooms were spacious, clean, quiet, and comfortable. The beds were amazing.

We noticed that the hotel restaurant was also listed as one of the top restaurants in Hue by Tripadvisor and we weren't disappointed.

Everyone who worked at the hotel was attentive, polite, nice, and accommodating. The staff made us feel at home from the moment we arrived to the moment we left.

We had booked a pick up from the airport and was very glad to see our driver on arrival at the airport.
When we drove into the alley where the hotel is my husband was slightly concerned asking where have you booked! But it was all good, staff where excellent, rooms clean and a good size - we had booked a city view which also had a balcony.
A bit of noise from guests locking and unlocking their rooms, hubby commented it sounded like locking cell doors in a prison, but that was a slight over exaggeration.
We booked a trip through the hotel, boat out to the pagoda and private car out to 2 tombs which cost us USD45, probably could have got cheaper elsewhere but with only 2 days in the city it was easy to arrange. The car was a new 4x4 which was very comfortable on a very hot day.

From the very start, we were greeted warmly by the staff and given a lovely tray of drinks and fruit upon our arrival. Our room, the least expensive available, was spacious, very attractive and clean, with a large bathroom -- with a tub! -- and all of the amenities. It was quiet and comfortable. The restaurant served delicious food (we had two breakfasts and a dinner there). The staff was absolutely terrific. They helped put together a tour for us with drivers and guides which was went perfectly, provided us with Vietnamese newspapers to bring home for our daughter's design project, arranged a transfer to the airport, stored our luggage while we were out for the day and offered us showers after we had checked out of our room before we left for the airport. Everyone -- the front desk staff, the doormen, the waitresses -- were so friendly and welcoming that it felt less like a hotel and more like we were their personal and valued guests.

Feb 2016,"Serene Palace lives up to its reputation as an excellent hotel. While I will give details of little things that may or may not affect your decision to stay there, the overall experience can not be faulted. This is due mainly to the staff, who provide excellent service with a smile from the moment you enter the door to the moment you leave. Welcome drink and fruit greet you, and fruit is also provided in your room each day along with a bottle of water and coffee and tea for each guest. Of course, breakfast pretty much has all you can eat fruit as well. Also included in breakfast is a menu that you can order from to your heart's delight.

We paid more for a balcony room, but there was no balcony furniture, so we couldn't actually sit out there, which is something we love to do and a reason we pay for such rooms. Perhaps they have furniture out there in other seasons, but honestly, there was very little room to accommodate furniture. It's more of a standing balcony, which for us, defeats the purpose.

Our room included a safe, a jetted tub (not so easy to shower in as the hand held shower head doesn't have a long extension, but lovely to soak in), a kettle, a comfortable sitting area near the window, and best of all a desktop computer (it would occasionally crash, but we found it more useful than we would have imagined and definitely missed it when we moved on to other cities).

As we stayed 4 nights, the hotel offered free pick-up at the train station. Our train was 2 hours late, but they were there waiting with a smile and a clearly marked sign with our name.

We would definitely recommend staying here and would come back to Hue simply to do so again.

Jenny was always replying to my questions through the emails immediately and giving us some good advice as well. (eg: I asked her to organize a big car from the airport for 4 adults & 2 kids. Firstly she offered a 7 seaters car, but she thought we might struggle with lots of luggage so she gently asked if we needed 16 seaters car which she was right! we could not have fit into the 7 seater ! )
We also want to say thank you to the driver for both legs, he drove really carefully. ( and did not take any calls while he was driving.) We were very happy to see he was our driver again for the second leg to Hoi An.Please let him know how much we appreciated it. (always nervous with the kids.)

Our kids wanted to go back to this hotel when we were in Hoi An, as the staff were really kind with them.

We also liked the breakfasts a lot! The fruits (especially mango) were really tasty.
I had beef pho every day for breakfast. I already miss it!!
The hotel itself is relatively simple compared with big international hotels, but is has everything you need for a short trip to Hue and is kept really clean and is clearly very well run.
We have already recommended some of our friends who are planning to go in March.

Feb 2016,"The best thing about this hotel is easily the restaurant, although it's great on almost everything else too. The restaurant in the hotel is (at the time of writing) TripAdvisor's number 1 restaurant in Hue, and is very tasty, especially since it's also really cheap. The breakfast they served was also quite good. The staff were very friendly and chatty and remember you and your food preferences when you return. When I asked if they could make a packed sandwich for my lunch, they did it with a smile and at no charge. The restaurant was packed every evening.
The check-in was smooth and we were given tonnes of info on Hue and possible tours. The staff were all nice and friendly. The rooms were clean, spacious and comfortable, and even contained a computer in case you fancy doing a bit of light work. Our standard room contained a bath, and the shower worked well. The soap and toiletries were pretty cheap and could do with an upgrade, along with the in-room safe which was old and fidgety and always took many frustrated attempts to get open.
The location is central but it's located down a dark and dodgy looking alley. If you approach from the north it's not too far into the alley and it's lit, but if you're coming from the south then you either have to walk down a long, dark & narrow alley, or go the long way around.",40,83,"Dublin, Ireland",56,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theallseeingguy,theallseeingguy,February 2016,Great hotel with a great restauramt,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293926-d4357913-Reviews-or1080-Hue_Serene_Palace_Hotel-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html#REVIEWS
Feb 2016,"Pity about the location - down that long narrow lane. We didn't know what sort of a dive the taxi driver was bringing us to.
However, as soon as we stepped out of the taxi, all our concerns were assuaged by the welcome, and the friendliness of the reception girls who made us feel right at home.
Even though we arrived before 11:00 am, they got our rooms ready, and our bags up while we had welcome drinks and fruit bowl.

The room itself was lovely, and the bed very comfortable. Good wifi.

Another advantage is that you don't have to go far for one of the best restaurants in Hue - it's inhouse. If you forget to book a table, they'll call you as soon as one is free, and the tables are turned over quickly.

Best of all, the price is so reasonable. However, we got better prices from Cafe on Thu Wheels for tours and transfers.

Jan 2016,"We enjoyed our seven night stay at the Serene. The rooms are reasonably spacious although a little short of storage space, the bed is comfortable (although the sheet arrangement is a little quirky) and the aircon works well. There’s also a computer terminal (as well as free wifi) in each room. Go for a room on the top floor with a balcony for nice views of the town. Breakfast is OK, and the other meals are actually pretty good, although the setting (basically an extension of the hotel lobby) lacks a bit of ambience.

Where the Serene excels however is it’s staff. Jenny was very helpful in answering our questions before we arrived and the wonderful Sally and the restaurant staff couldn’t do enough for us.

One word about the location: it’s down a quiet lane, which means it is out of the bothersome traffic (don’t be worried by the nearby karaoke bars, we hardly heard a peep from them). However, the lane itself is potholed and gets very muddy and slippery when it rains. My partner went over and cut her leg and hand quite badly just outside the hotel. Sally and other staff went immediately into action with the first aid kit, and there was no permanent damage done. However, the lane way sometimes needs hiking boots! Work was underway while we were there to smooth out the surface with sand but a more permanent surface would be a great improvement.

The first room we stayed in was very clean and spacious. The second room we were moved to was clean as well but smelled like sewage.

We did inform them and they said that they would look into it so we hope they take care of it because the smell was suffocating!

Breakfast there was pretty good. Was a bit westernized for the guests which is good and bad.

We really appreciated that they allowed us to do that!

Our only complaint was the location as it is located down a narrow alley and the van that took our family there had a very difficult time maneuvering through the alley.

The hotel is indeed located down an alley with other hotels and coffee shops, but we found the hotel to be quiet and peaceful. It is walking distance to shops and restaurants ,and we walked several times to the river and the market. For those not inclined to walk the distance, the hotel staff promptly can arrange taxi service.

Breakfast was nice too; buffet of fruit and bread plus we could order off the menu. We were unwell for a couple of days while staying here and ordered room service a few times. Not incredible food but always prompt and hot.

The location down the alley is a little odd perhaps but it gave it character and meant the hotel was pretty quiet. Close enough to walk to the Citadel - about twenty minutes.

Jan 2016,"This is one of those instances where what I found in TA did not meet my expectations. I stayed in hotels in Hanoi, Hoi An, Saigon and this was my least favorite. The pictures you see are better than what you get in person. One thing I realized about Hue is that there is no such thing as a central location. The sites are just all over the place that you just have to find a hotel that you like and go for it. Maybe the standards in Hue are different than in other places in Vietnam but if this hotel gets 5 stars from TA then I dont know what a true 5 star really means.

Let me start with the good, the email communication with this hotel is excellent. Jenny responded to every single question I sent via email, quick and reliable. I needed a very quiet room and they delivered on the top floor. On our first night our neighbor had their TV blasting, you can hear it through the concrete walls. Maybe they should rethink on how the TV is mounted on the wall. There is also a Karaoke bar close to the hotel and I can hear it from my top floor room. I had to wear my earplugs when I sleep. Keep in mind that I am very sensitive to sound so this might not be an issue for a normal person. Jenny also gave us a good rate for a pickup from Hoi An to the hotel (55 USD). Very good car service. The location is a bit not to my preference. Its on a narrow alley with a lot of local establishments which is fine if this is your taste. Is it central? it depends on what you are looking for. If you want the tourist sites then not really as I mentioned above, they are all over the place. We walked from the hotel to the Citadel and it was a 20 min walk and we are fast walkers. You can walk to a lot of restaurants and shops from the hotel. Which is why I put the location still on the positive side. The internet is really fast and they even give you a desktop in the room, this was very helpful.

Now for the not so good. Throughout my travels in Vietnam I have encountered a different level of excellent service in different hotels which made it very memorable. However, I did not get that impression from this place during our stay. I can't put my finger in it but the service was just lacking and inconsistent. I think I got the best service from the bell boys who help us with the luggage and open the doors for us all the time. Those front desk girls, not so much. I had a few instances when I felt some attitude. Maybe its a language barrier but I didnt feel that in other hotels in Vietnam. We dropped off our laundry in the morning and I asked the front desk what time will it be available and they said in the evening. When I picked it up in the evening, it wasn't there. Instead of being apologetic, the girl kept questioning me if I dropped it off because she couldnt find it. At last when Jenny looked into it, she found it. When we checked the items, we were missing a sock. We went down and they found it somewhere. You also dont get the best information when you ask for restaurants or whats what. Things like this bothered me about the service. Service for me is only 3 stars.

There were a few noise issues during my stay, the loud TV in the adjacent room, the karaoke bar and the dragging furniture from people who are cleaning early Sunday morning. Mind you, we were on the top floor so these noises came from adjacent rooms. For a small place like this with just a few rooms I dont think they should start dragging furniture till after 9. .

Aesthetically, beauty of the property is only skin deep. It is clean but as one looks closely, there are some things that are worth mentioning. The bathroom grout and caulking is falling apart. I dont know if it is mold or mildew but there are black stuff in the caulking. Hand held showers dont work for me. The interior is just cheap and tacky for my taste. You have to lock the door when you leave and it is not just a matter of click and close. Its more of a pull and turn and turn and turn. They need to upgrade their lock system.

Before you get too excited about more than a thousand reviews resulting to a 5 star rating for this hotel, pick and choose which reviews you can trust. Thats not just for this hotel but for any review out there. It is all about credibility. I am not saying this hotel is bad but im definitely not a fan. I just feel that there are other hotels in the same price point that could give me more satisfaction. In retrospect, I would have rather paid more money and stayed at the M Gallery or the Indochine Palace. If are a bit tight on budget and you are not concerned about the points I mentioned above then this place might work for you.",30,301,"Chicago, Illinois",805,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexisRF,AlexisRF,December 2015,Lukewarm,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293926-d4357913-Reviews-or1130-Hue_Serene_Palace_Hotel-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html#REVIEWS

Too tired to venture outside for dinner we thought we would try the hotel’s restaurant for dinner. Trip Advisor had rated it number one in Hue and we were not disappointed. The food was fantastic! We tried the pomelo salad, morning glory salad, crispy seafood pancakes and chicken curry and loved every bite. The girls in the restaurant are very efficient and so friendly, all of them spend time at each table getting to know the clients. The lady in charge Miss Sally is delightful and ensures everything goes smoothly.
The breakfast buffet was also very good with the usual fresh fruits and breads and a good choice of hot cooked to order items.
After a full day visiting the tombs and citadel we returned to the hotel and once again had dinner there, we had enjoyed our previous dinner so much that we ordered the same food again and shared it between us! Whoever is in the kitchen is doing a fantastic job!

Dec 2015,"The Serene Palace was one of the best hotels we stayed at in our 4 week tour and at a bit less than 27USD/night for the Superior Double it was exceptional value. Every aspect of our stay was impressive. Our room was large, very clean, nicely decorated and had a window that opened. The bed was large and very comfortable with good pillows. It had arm chairs and a coffee table as well as a desk and chair. It also had a computer in the room. WiFi connection was faultless. Air conditioning was adjustable and much appreciated after a few hours exploring. The en-suite was a good size with reliable hot water and pressure. The hotel had a good sized lift. The laundry service was good value. The staff were friendly and helpful. I especially appreciated the 'bell boys' who were engaging and quick with a smile, to open doors and to help with luggage. Breakfast was excellent with lots of variety. In a country where exceptional hotel service seems to be the norm, the dining staff at the Serene Palace really are exceptional. Sally who seemed to be the restaurant manager made a point of greeting all clients and making sure their needs were taken care of. When she knew I wasn't well, she made ginger tea for me and had a colleague go buy me yoghurt because my husband had suggested I might be able to eat it. The Serene Palace has the number 1 ranking for dining in Hue and we had some memorable evening meals at very good prices. If staying at the hotel, they give a 10% discount on food. Its location on a small road/lane meant the hotel was quiet but it is an easy walk to the river and Palace and we felt safe walking in the area at night.The fare from the railway station in a green Mai Linh taxi (one of the taxi companies reputed to be reliable) was 50 000VND (about 3.30 AUD). We did walk to the station and back one day but it is a fair distance with luggage.

When we were leaving I realised that I had left my watch in the safe (it was unlocked but we hadn't noticed it when taking our other things out).

The location of the hotel is ideal for travellers who would want to experience the local lifestyle. The market is within walking distance with shops, eateries and restaurants nearby.

Nov 2015,"Stayed here with my fiance Nov 2015. First off, you're better off emailing the hotel ahead and asking to get a transfer from the airport. Our taxi driver wasn't sure where it was even after we gave him the address, or he just didn't want to drive down the narrow, almost hidden little alley, so we walked down until we found it. Luckily, it wasn't very far, took us about 2 minutes. Look out for signs for the ""Serene Palace Restaurant.""

The hotel staff were very attentive and spoke great English. They organised all our tours for us very easily. The room was very spacious and clean with the usual complimentary water, tea, coffee and also fruit which was a nice surprise.

One very minor thing though, the door is a bit stiff and the lock is a bit finnicky. Also, the bed was HUGE! But very comfortable. However, the sheets were actually two blankets layered in such a way to cover the whole bed. This actually worked out better when we took them off and just had one blanket each. These are all very minor things, did not detract from the experience at all.

Breakfast was also extremely good. The set up is not so much a buffet as it is a cafe. They seat you with a menu which has European and Viet options. Try the fried dumplings! Special mention to Sally there who always took care of us, and even packed us a bunch of bananas to take with us when we checked out!

Finally, definitely try the restaurant for lunch and/or dinner! The food was sublime, especially the garlic prawns. And you can get anything you like from the restaurant via room service.

Overall, we really enjoyed our stay here and would recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Hue.",50,9,"Sydney, Australia",18,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garyigoldie,Gary G,November 2015,Fantastic hotel,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293926-d4357913-Reviews-or1180-Hue_Serene_Palace_Hotel-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html#REVIEWS

Nov 2015,"Our stay at the Serene Palace Hotel was short. We only stayed 1 night as we were on our way to Hoi An & Da Nang the next morning.

The room was very spacious. Clean. And nicely decorated. I am a bit of nit pick when it comes to bathrooms and the cleanliness of the bathroom fixtures. This hotel did not disappoint. The WiFi in the hotel worked better than in our hotel in Saigon.

The hotel is located in an alley that is nice and quiet. The location requires you to walk a little bit (500m) to get to the busy street on the south side called Nguyen Thai Hoc to get to the plentiful restaurants and side-walk food stands.I purposely look for hotels in quiet alleys for a bit of peace.

Most appreciated was the staff and the service that we received at this hotel - Serene Palace hotel. My parents and I were very happy with the young adults (recent university grads) who were happy to attend to our needs while also taking the opportunity to practise their English. The English communication skills of the staff was very good. (Disclaimer: I can speak Vietnamese. But like a child who grew up in the South of Vietnam. But, I have a difficult time understanding the strong Vietnamese accent of the Hue region. I prefer to speak in English whenever possible in Vietnam because thinking in English is easier for me.

We arrived off an overnight sleeper train and they were so welcoming helping with bags, giving us some tasty fruit and juice. The breakfast is another highlight as it's basically all you can eat so definitely worth paying for this. The only thing to be aware of us that it's on a lane, about 3 mins walk off the main road.

Oct 2015,"This is another hotel where it's Tripadvisor standing is a puzzle to me. It was clean and staff were efficient but otherwise it was merely functional, lacking in any sort of charm, character or flair; Internally it was bland with cheap finishes.
The bed had a strange two duvet set up which was far too hot. However, when I took the top duvet off, the bottom one was so short that my feet stuck out the end and I am only 5'3""! The pillows were solid.
The bathroom had the most ridiculous bath I've ever seen in a hotel, so short it was impossible to do other than half lie and so narrow that elbows banged against the sides. Because it is a whirlpool bath, there is a nozzle in the end just where the small of the back should go - So uncomfortable!
The room is very noisy and it is possible to hear what is happening from quite a way away.
On the plus side the staff tried hard. A very good driver was arranged to collect us from the airport and he also took us on a tour round the tombs and citadel.
Breakfasts were fairly dull but the lunch we ate in the restaurant was excellent. We did not eat dinner here because the restaurant lacked atmosphere - it was just more fun to go into town to eat.

Oct 2015,"The staff at this hotel we were very welcoming and obliging. Restaurant staff were good too. The location was very good. However, we came away with the feeling that whoever designed this hotel and its rooms had never actually stayed in a hotel themselves. The room itself was spacious and reasonably quiet but that's about the best thing I can say about it. The curtains were about 25 cms too short so that light entered under them early morning. Other than a rail in the robe on which to hang clothes, and the total of four tiny drawers in the desk and bedside tables (in which you might just fit a Gideon's bible), there was absolutely nowhere in the room in which to store anything else (underwear etc), which meant we had to leave EVERYTHING in our cases and rummage through them any time we wanted something. Doing this for the four days we were in Hue was very frustrating. The power outlets were in the weirdest places. We could not find anywhere to plug in the electric jug that didn't leave the jug (which had a ridiculously short cord) at a dangerous and preposterous angle. In the end, we placed it on the bench in the bathroom, on top of a book, so that the cord could reach the power outlet there. Admittedly, this hotel was very reasonably priced, but had we known what to expect beforehand we would have gladly paid a few more dollars or dong to get decent basic facilities. Maybe the hotel owners can provide each room with longer curtains, jugs with longer cords, and a chest of drawers, and charge a couple of dollars more. It would certainly make a stay in this hotel so much more pleasant.",30,22,Canberra,35,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BettyBoop51,BettyBoop51,September 2015,"Good staff, room leaves a lot to be desired",Trip type: Traveled as a couple,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293926-d4357913-Reviews-or1210-Hue_Serene_Palace_Hotel-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html#REVIEWS

The rooms are spacious with a wonderfully comfortable bed (a delight after the soft sleeper on the train). There is also a pc for you to use in the room if needed. There are tea and coffee making facilities in the room and fresh fruit and bottled water supplied daily.

Bathroom is big with a fantastic high pressure shower. Toiletries are supplied. My only complaint with the bathroom (at a push) would be that you couldn't adjust the shower head and so the water tended to leak over the side but this was countered with a recessed drain beside the bath.

Wifi was patchy on my phone but the tablet picked it up ok. Sound transmits, we could hear rooms being cleaned upstairs and footsteps on the stairs quite easily. That said we slept fairly soundly.

Breakfast steals the show. You can order as much from the menu as you like. Tea/coffee/fruit juice. The pancakes and dumplings are delicious.

Staff were friendly and helpful at all times. They are able to arrange bus/train/taxi as needed.

The attached restaurant provides a really superb included breakfast, and is a handy place to try out local dishes for dinner in scrupulously clean surroundings.
The service at reception, from the bellboys, the cleaning staff and the restaurant staff was faultless, and always performed with a charming smile.

Oct 2015,"Wonderful 3 night stay at Serene.
First impressions of this wonderful, friendly hotel in Hue are misleading. It's situated in a non-description narrow road, the entrance is rather plain and the restaurant looks very functional. But don't be deceived! The staff are extremely helpful and friendly, the rooms spotlessly clean, comfortable and spacious, and the food in the restaurant is terrific. 'Sally' runs the restaurant. She and her team love to engage with the guests, and if you join in you will be treated to a lot of fun and laughter, but whatever you do you will receive attentive service. We ate in the restaurant every morning and had some evening meals. We were not disappointed, enjoying really excellent food for very little money. This is a lovely hotel which is brilliant value - you will be pleased you decided to stay there!

From the moment you step into the Serene Palace you are aware of a full and warm welcome. The staff fall over themselves to be warm, helpful and friendly. The staff here, from the door men, the service desk, the kitchen staff to housekeeping are fantastic. Nothing is too much trouble. From organising tours, helping with local information, providing airport pick up and drop off .

It's situated in a non-description narrow road, the entrance is rather plain and the restaurant looks very functional. But don't be deceived! The staff are extremely helpful and friendly, the rooms spotlessly clean, comfortable and spacious, and the food in the restaurant is terrific. The remarkable 'Sally' runs the restaurant. She and her team love to engage with the guests, and if you join in you will be treated to a lot of fun and laughter, but whatever you do you will receive attentive service.

Sep 2015,"Overall, Hue Serene Palace is a fantastic place to stay particularly given the price tag. However, we experienced a couple things that cause pause and should be voiced.

The Good: The cleanliness of this hotel for the price and location is absolutely astounding. The decor inside the room is new. The beds are incredibly comfortable. I can't believe we paid $17 USD for the room. Yes, they each have a desktop computer included in the room. Flatscreen TV, plenty of channels in English as well as strong wifi. Daily fruit and water are provided in the room.

Breakfast deserves some special accolades. It's beyond generous! ALYC and we ate our room rate's worth daily.

Could be improved: Aside from the many TA mentions of the hotel's location, I concur that the dirt, potholed road leading to the alley of karaoke bars is not ideal.

The other three areas that need attention include: the restaurant staff implying improper ""services"" provided to guests; the ease in extending stays and noise.

1) This is hard to report, as the restaurant staff is so kind. However, it deserves a mention. Restaurant staff commented at EVERY meal about my male travel partner - his looks, his relationship status, etc. One night, he ordered take away and they stated he could have room service instead. He was then asked which waitress he would like to bring up his meal. He asked for clarification and was then told that all the staff like him, so he could choose who brought his food to his room. It takes a lot to make a 6'4"" white American man uncomfortable, but this offer absolutely did.

Hue has a huge issue with both prostitution and drugs. After several days of interactions with the staff, I could tell they are really nice women and tend to joke around a bit with guests. I don't think it was meant as a prostitution offer. However, to imply that he could have his pick of waitresses to bring food up to his bedroom could really put staff at risk had he expected anything other than the simple delivery of food. It should be addressed so the staff are kept safe (and wives and girlfriends don't get upset).

2) Upon expressing an interest in extending our hotel stay, it was a bit of a hassle to negotiate the same booked rate we found online. I prefer to have the hotel receive my money directly upon extension, rather than a 3rd party taking their cut, especially if I at all like the hotel. In my attempt to extend my $17 rate ($20.18 with tax), I was offered $32/night. When stating what I paid, I was told that was impossible, they didn't offer such a low rate. After pulling it up on the 3rd party site, staff then said it was a $17 rate with $8 in taxes. Again, I had to show them what I paid, tax inclusive. We went back and forth and I was finally offered the same rate. It should have been a bit more clearcut to provide them with my money.

3) the design of the hotel encourages noise to travel from floor to floor of this hotel. Guests slamming doors, yelling, running up and down the stairs at all hours is really disruptive requiring rear plugs. They've installed a door from the ground floor to floor two, muffling the breakfast noise so many other TripAdvisor reviews mention. These soundproof doors should be installed at least floor to floor. It would be even better to have these doors (the same as the bathroom doors) installed as the doors to each room. They would eliminate the noise issue.

Tip: Metered taxis from the train station are only 40K. Don't let them talk you into anything more than 50K.",30,105,"Nashville, Tennessee",298,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vagabond_Yogini,Megan S,September 2015,High Highs and Low Lows,Trip type: Traveled with friends,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293926-d4357913-Reviews-or1240-Hue_Serene_Palace_Hotel-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html#REVIEWS

Sep 2015,"My parents and I were in Hue for the very first time and our guide assigned us this hotel. When we were walking in the alley from the main road, we thought this hotel might just be the worse we will stay in Vietnam. Well, we were proven very wrong. As soon as we were at the entrance, the staff took great care of us, offered to carry our luggage, offered us a welcome drink with a plate of fruits. Then they carried our luggage to our room, got our room ready and then showed us the way to our room. All the staff here were super friendly, from receptionist to restaurant staff. They were all very personal in their service. The room itself is the best we have stayed in during our whole trip in Central Vietnam. Too bad it was only for a night. The restaurant is ranked no.1 on TripAdvisor. You could order anything off the menu for breakfast and mind you, the food is super tasty. We had our dinner in the restaurant as well, with a discount as in-house guests. I have never had a better stay than here. They even went all the way to send me an email after my stay to thank us for staying. My parents and I all agreed totally that this is the best hotel we have ever stayed in!

The only thing I would avoid against doing is booking your transport/car service in Hue through the hotel as we paid $35 to go to three different places (excluding entrance fees) and we could have paid a LOT less if we just booked separate taxis. It was convenient, but not the cheapest option.

The friendly welcome, fruit juice and plate of fruit was much appreciated in the heat. Our room did not disappoint, clean, tidy. Had a safe and fridge, bath robes, TV. Everything you could need. Shower excellent.

Breakfast was a feast with a choice of western or vietnamese cuisine, or both! Plus a self service fruit buffet. The breakfast was in the restaurant which was itself a very decent eating spot and we chose to eat back at the hotel for a couple of nights because it was that good.

Aug 2015,"As soon as you enter the place, you are greeted by friendly and helpful staff with a complimentary drink and fruit. They quickly checked me in and took me into my room immediately (via elevator), especially great after an overnight train from Hanoi. I was even a few hours early for check-in but they still accommodated me. Brilliant!

Beautiful and clean room, which had complimentary fruit and water daily. This was about $25USD, bathroom and room itself is very spacious and modern. Safe is there for you to store valuables, Desktop computer there, tv and wifi too should you need it, closet with hangers along with some beautiful ornaments for the room. Almost felt museum-like.

Tip for room: One with windows. I was in a room with windows, but was covered up because it'd mean staring out into the corridoor. The room I had was in between rooms with window views, but they later upgraded me to a room with a balcony and massage bath. I think because of my earlier than expected check-in, I got the first room. Not that I mind, I was there for a really short 2 night stay. I was just grateful!

Staff are so friendly and very accommodating. Sourced me a driver to do my own personal itinerary when I called from room. Sorted in 10 mins. Staff provided great advice for tours, temples and local spots - found a really good restaurant - can't recall now, but oh so delicious! I went there a lot! Ask them! It might pay to take someone who can speak vietnamese with you for translations. I took my driver the first time, then they just knew my order eventually...

Driver via hotel = $15USD or so for the whole day. Found a tad pricey for what I'd received throughout Vietnam, but didn't have the time to go out and barter. Driver was friendly but relaxed. Watch out though, I found he'd take me through certain routes because he 'needed' to, but really gave locals the opportunity to try sell me things. I'd find myself being shown how to make essences then all of a sudden, I'd be looking at someone selling me postcards, paintings whatever while my driver was just sitting casually within the store staring back at me. So I just took it as an opportunity to chat with locals and gain some insight into their way of life

Aside from that, hotel is very nice! Breakfast is tasty (and free as part of the deal I got with hotel) and a lot of options both western or traditional. I went for plenty of rounds of banana choc pancakes, eggs and Vietnamese dishes. Really tasty and made to order. Location wise, it's a bit of a walk to the Emperors (about 10-15 mins), but it gives you the chance to just soak in more of Hue, because it's beautiful

When checking out, the hotel let me store my things there while I tiki-toured some more and when I came back, I was pouring sweat that they let me into a room that was free to freshen up before hitching a ride back to the train station to leave for Hoi An. Absolutely wonderful of them!

I highly recommend Serene place without any hesitation!

Aug 2015,"I booked a room at this hotel for a three-night stay on the basis of the very good reviews on Tripadvisor. I wondered if it could be as good as the review suggested. It is. The quality of this hotel is better than many other much more expensive alternatives.
As other reviews have pointed out the location of the hotel is less than perfect, down a narrow lane which when rain falls becomes muddy and covered with puddles. It is however in the centre of the ‘Tourist area” and there are many cafes, restaurants, bars etc in the surrounding area. However it is worth navigating the lane for the quality of the hotel when you arrive.
I had booked a front facing room on a higher floor. The room was large, very clean and with modern furniture. The bed was very comfortable. A computer was provided in the room and wifi was free, fast and stable. The air con was easily controllable and quiet. The water pressure in the shower good and warm water arrived very quickly. My room rate included breakfast . This provided both western and Vietnamese options, and I tried both during my stay, there is also a range of fruit and breads and pastries to which you help yourself buffet style. Overall the breakfast was good without being exceptional.
However what was in my view exceptional was the professionalism, efficiency, friendliness and helpfulness of the staff – all of the staff. I visit many hotels for both business and pleasure, some of them far more expensive that the Serene Palace; some have one or two staff whom one remembers for their efficiency or helpfulness, but I have never stayed in any hotel where ALL the staff have been so exceptional in both the performance of their duties, in their friendliness, whilst never being intrusive, and in going the “extra mile” to help.

He took us to parts of the Vinh Moc tunnels that you don't normally see on a guided tour (because they were pitch black!).
The staff also went to the train station and bought our tickets to Hanoi for us to save us the hassle of going out to the station (more time for soghtseeing).

Jul 2015,"I'm terribly lazy at writing reviews, but the service and attitude at this hotel was so excellent I simply have to add my comment. We arrived early in the morning after an awful night at sleeper bus (I'd never choose that again...). I had got sick in the bus plus we felt tired and dirty, so I asked if they'd have a room available - and they didn't only give us a room immediately but also upgraded to a bigger room with a balcony, and all that free of charge! We really appreciated that. In general, all the staff was very friendly, helpful, always greeting us with a smile. Also the restaurant staff was great. We don't usually like to use hotel restaurants, but since the breakfast had been excellent and we had read some good reviews about the food, we decided to dine there. The reviews were correct: food was tasty and there were enough choices for vegetarians as well, but again the best thing was the service, quick, friendly and even more: we had been given discount coupons on arrival but we had forgotten them totally, and were thus expecting to pay the normal price - but the waitress who recognized us from the breakfast gave the discount automatically! What could be better service? I wish I could remember her name so I could address my thanks to her.

The hotel arranged a car for us and it took approx 30 min to get there - very nice to get a break from all the cultural sightseeing and relax on the beach for some hours.

Jul 2015,"Don't even think about booking at a different hotel! We stayed at the Serene Palace for 5 nights, and it was one of the best hotel experiences we ever had. If there was a six star option, they would have got it. Although being a big hotel, every staff member knew us by name, and cared personally for our well being and good time. We booked several day tours through the reception, and they were all for a fair price, and most of them (all but one, that was a group tour with an external company) were of superb quality.
The rooms are big, with all the amenities you need. You are given a free plate of fruit every day, along with the regular water bottles. They even have bathrobes, which are not common in hotels in this price range.
The restaurant is hands down the best in the city, and we ate several meals there. The local food is of top quality, and in very cheap prices. The included breakfast is also very good, and you can get some good Vietnamese coffee. The best aspect in the restaurant though is the amazing staff, commandeered by the lovely and very professional Hien (Sally). You are treated as one of the family. I was sick one day, and kept getting free ginger-lemon tea, during dinner, and even to my room. When we left for tour, even at 6:30am, there was always breakfast, and we were always handed a bag of fresh fruit for the day. We were very sad to leave all our new friends when we continued our trip - tears were shed on both sides.

Jul 2015,"As with all the other reviews, we found this place absolutely faultless. Prior to even arriving they sent emails about airport transfers rather than us having to contact them. They replied emails very fast and transfers were easy. Every single employee from the receptionist to the housekeeping, waitresses and drivers were very friendly and easy to talk to. Special thanks to Mary, the guy and girl at the front desk who talked to us about the tombs, and the two waitress who served us!

The front desk staff spoke fluent English and were very helpful - they helped us book things and recommended restaurants and attractions. When we were running out of time to go to the tombs, they arranged an early schedule prior to our train so we could visit and make the most of our time.

The restaurant had fantastic service and one of the best meals we've had in Vietnam. My fav was the pomelo salad and my bf loved the bun bo hue. Breakfast was also excellent with great coffee, fruit & whatever you'd like to order.

Everything was very thoughtfully considered such as the slippers in the room being larger sizes (we're both tall with bigger feet than Vietnamese people), fresh fruit and juice on arrival and the air con in the room already on as we checked in. It's these little details that set Serene apart from the rest.

The only issue was I booked a double and was meant to get a king sized bed but ours was two twin mattresses put together.

Whatever Serene is doing to train it's staff, they are doing it right. Keep up what you're doing, we will definitely be back! Thank you for everything!

Jul 2015,"I did not stay at this hotel, however all i did was eat at the hotel restaurant because it was rated quite highly and i was in the vicinity. I had just spent a whole day exploring Hue after coming down from Hanoi via overnight train and i had not had proper rest or a shower in 2 days. After exploring Hue in a killer weather (it was extremely hot when i went), i was sweaty and smelly and exhausted so i just wanted to find a nice, relaxing, cooling dinner place to sit down and have a simple meal. I went into Serene hotel's restaurant for a meal and after i ate there i noticed that they had showering facilities in their shared bathroom in the lobby. i took a chance and asked the restaurant and hotel staff if my friend and i could use their showering facilities because we haven't had a shower in 2 days and they were extremely gracious at not only letting us use the shower but loaning us towels as well! After the shower, while waiting for my friend to be done showering, i fell asleep in the lobby. My friend joined me shortly after. Not only did they allow us to rest there for almost 2 hours, they even offered us a hot cup of tea/coffee and a bag of fruits when we woke up. Amazing service!

Jul 2015,"Serene Hotel – Hue

I thought our last hotel was superb (Royal River in Hoi An), but the Serene Palace in Hue is almost as good at only half the price (US$26). I believe that if you book direct you can get it even cheaper. I booked the Serene Hotel in Hanoi through the desk here and they gave me a small discount to the internet price plus free pick-up.

I don't need to dwell on the service here as every other review has done, except to say they take a personal interest in every guest, and the service is second to non.

Apart from the service, the restaurant is the prize asset. You can get a six course fixed menu dinner for two for 259,000 vnd, and it's an amazing meal. Other dishes available average around 60,000. Breakfast is a-la cart, eggs to order or just about anything else you fancy. Just ask Ami.

We stayed for four days. On arrival we were upgraded to a deluxe room with a bath. We arrived around 8.30am and were able to check in immediately. We take the evening train to Hanoi, and arranged checkout for 8pm.

The rooms are a decent size and come with a small desk complete with desktop computer, table and 2 chairs, wardrobe, luggage rack, two bedside tables with draws, robes, heaps of bathroom product, fresh fruit bowl every morning… basically everything you have come to expect from a hotel twice the price. Wifi is super fast

The location is good, with several cafes in the lane and plenty more around the corner.

The room was nice and comfortable for a very affordable price. And we had dinner and breakfast in their restaurant, and in both meals the food was excellent.
The only BUT that I could say is that the hotel is in a very narrow street and the hotels around that street don't know how to find this hotel. Taxis know about it though. So if you are walking outside the hotel, have a good look of where you have to turn left or right so you can come back with no problem.

The Serene Palace experience begins when you enter. (Don't let the street it's in fool you by the way). The door is always being held open for you. When you enter and when you leave. We got a fresh juice and a plate of fruit when we arrived and our bags were carried to our rooms.

The rooms are amazing! We got a huge soft bed! Good flatscreen with all moviechannels. Good working AC. Some free water, tea, coffee and fruit. And there was even a computer with internet in our room!

The bathroom was also quite big with a huge shower and loads of shampoos and stuff to choose from.

Goes without saying that everything was nice and clean!

Staff was very helpfull and spoke the best english (so far) of all hotels and hostels we've been. They will get you on your way in Hué. Even when we were just chilling in the lobby we got some free icetea.

Jun 2015,"I stayed here with my sister on the last night of a week-long stint in Vietnam. It was great! The ""Twin-share"" room was actually 2 double beds, and we had a fridge, kettle, coffee & tea provided, safety deposit box, tv with cable, and a computer (never seen that before in a hotel room!). The room was clean and comfortable, and the shower was great. Breakfast was included, and we could order whatever we wanted from the menu (both Vietnamese and western food) and they'd bring it out for us - eat as much as you like.

When we first got there we were a little confused about how to get to the hotel, as it was down an alleyway, but it was so close to everything! After we had checked in (they gave us cool towels and a drink of fresh passion fruit juice while we waited), they provided us with a map of Hue and circled the attractions we wanted to see. They also offered a trip to see the Pagoda and Ancient Citadel with a free taxi to the boats and private boat trip up and down the river for $20 USD total - and our driver came to pick us up just 15 minutes later! It was a great service. They also helped us to book a private car from Hue to Lang Co beach and then Ba Na hills, before heading to the airport in Da Nang. The driver was a bit pricey ($67 USD), but he gave us time to stop and take photos whenever we wanted, and played some cool music in his car. He also watched our bags while we were at Ba Na, and drove very well. We didn't mind too much, because in total we spent $32 AUD for the night for the ""twin-share"" room (breakfast included).

Jun 2015,"This is a really clean hotel. I mean really clean!
The staff are excellent Location is good. There is a Karoke bar next door but our room was at the back of the hotel on the 7th floor. It was very quiet.
The bar doesn't seem to make much noise anyway.
Our bed was very very comfy and huge.
The hotels restaurant is #1 on TA. So very easy if you want to eat at the hotel. They have a buy one, get one free mojito cocktail special all night and guests of the hotel get 10% off the bill. These deals make for an extremely cheap meal.
The hotel is in a good location. Come out of the front entrance and turn left and there are some lovely little cafes. If you turn right you are heading in the direction of the river. It's lovely to walk along the river in the evening towards the night market that starts at 7pm. The staff are very helpful with hints and directions.
We paid US$50 to have a full day private tour in a hotel car. I don't think this was really the best way to see Hue. We had to purchase our own combination ticket. (VND 280 each) this included 2 tombs and the citadel. There are two types of combination tickets. One has an extra temple. Honestly three temples is plenty. The problem with the hotel tour is that the driver has very little English so really gives no information to you at all. We had no idea what we were driving past or where we were driving to. Apparently you can pay more for a guide (US$30). It's all a bit expensive. I think you could find a driver who spoke English yourself and get a better tour.

Located in a relatively quiet alleyway, with a karaoke place beside it; despite that it was never noisy and I felt safe walking home at night. Got a nice spacious twin room that was clean and bright with comfy bed and good air conditioning in the hot summer weather. Beautiful room. Water pressure was also good (some budget hotels have really weak water pressure) which made baths so much more enjoyable amidst the summer heat. Breakfast was simple yet delicious with a good mix of food choices, juices and local fruits. Staff were friendly and accommodating to my request of a cup of hot water for my daily dosage of wolfberries tea with a smile.

However, it would be much better if reception staff could provide more detailed information on the nearby amenities apart from those of the tours.

Jun 2015,"Email correspondence with the hotel before arriving was answered promptly by Jenny.

We arranged with the hotel to pick us up from the train station and a staff Brian was waiting for us when we arrived. He flagged a taxi for us to bring us to the hotel. The cost was 4 USD which is more expensive than we getting a taxi on our own but we didn't mind as this saved us the trouble to haggle with taxi driver in an unfamiliar location.

Upon arrival at the hotel we were given cold towels and fruits while we got our hotel room sorted out. We were given a room with a balcony on the 6th floor which we could watch sunset during our stay.

We also asked the hotel to arrange a private boat ride on the perfume river for the two of us costing 15 USD as well as a bus ride back to Hoi An for 5 USD each.

All the staff were genuinely friendly and helpful and the restaurant served excellent food so we didn't dine anywhere other than at the hotel restaurant.

The room and toilet were very clean but the bed a little soft which affected our sleep because when one of us moved, the other would feel the movement of the bed as well.

There was also a personal computer in the room which we didn't use. Fruits were provided everyday during our stay.

Location wise, the hotel is on a quiet back lane but within walking distance to most of the attractions. The night market is 10 minutes walk along the river.

We did enjoy our stay at The Serene Palace hotel and were very pleased with the excellent service of all the hotel staff.",50,243,"Singapore, Singapore",617,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TJX05,TJX05,May 2015,Excellent Hotel in Hue,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293926-d4357913-Reviews-or1380-Hue_Serene_Palace_Hotel-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html#REVIEWS

Jun 2015,"My fiancé and I have just recently spent 1 night at Serene Palace. We were in a city view double room on the top 7th floor.

The hotel is set just back from the main strip in a small side street. This certainly helped with street noise. I would recommend, though, to get a room higher up to avoid any possible noise from the karaoke club next door or the online gaming joint across the road. We certainly heard nothing from either.

The whole hotel looked very recently renovated/new. Our room was very clean and nicely decorated with a high ceiling. The king sized bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was fitted out with modern appliances.

However, most outstanding was the friendliness and efficiency of the staff, both front of house and wait staff. We shared many laughs as I tried out my basic Vietnamese! They also organised a car transfer to Hoi An for $65. This was great value as our fantastic driver, Huy, was happy to stop anywhere we wished. So what we thought was going to be a basic trip to Hoi An, ended up with stopping at a local fishing village; going for a swim in the ocean at Lang Co beach; having an amazing seafood lunch at a local overwater restaurant (our cost) and having the best Vietnamese iced coffee and view at the top of Hai Van Pass.

Restaurant: We are here multiple times and their prices are very fair and relatively cheap, what surprised me the most was they gave us 10% discounts on meals which was very nice and unexpected.

Breakfast: The breakfast is the best! In my 4 nights here I probably ate 4 mangos just at breakfast the fruit selection is amazing! The breakfast menu is fairly large and you can order how much you want, and when your full you still get offered to order more :)

Room: Room was very clean and we no problems at all, I'd admit I had a 10 minute shower and the hot water showed no signs of running out. I found it had awesome WIFI being able to load youtube and blog.

Staff: The staff are the absolute best part of the hotel, the best hospitality I have ever experienced. Very friendly and speak good English, I never once felt like I was being sold to It felt like we were the king and queen of the palace.

We could not believe that for this price we could get a room this spacious and beautiful. We were greated by the friendly staff with a welcome juice and fruits, they helped us with transportation and laundry services. We got a restaurant recommendation and although sometimes I am a bit careful with such tipps, this one was actually great! The breakfast was really good and there as well, the staff was very lovely. On top of it all, our room (with complimentary fruits and coffee/water, a PC station and the most comfortable bath robes) had a nice view of the city and the incredible sunset.

Apr 2015,"We booked our stay at Hue Serene Palace because of the good reviews and reasonable price of the rooms - and we were not disappointed! We were very impressed by the facilities - including the reception drink and fruit platter in the hotel's beautiful lobby. The rooms and ensuite were lovely - clean, spacious and modern - probably the nicest we had during our 2 week stay in Vietnam.

The location is great - hidden away down an alley and just a short walk from the tourist streets.

Breakfast was fantastic with a great choice of menu items as well as an amazing selection of fresh local fruit. This was the best breakfast we had in Vietnam. The veg pho is highly recommended!

And the staff were all extremely friendly, helpful and welcoming.

Highly recommended and quite posh for a 3 start hotel.",50,6,NA,8,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/314valb,Val B,April 2015,Fantastic place to stay in Hue!!,Trip type: Traveled with family,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293926-d4357913-Reviews-or1450-Hue_Serene_Palace_Hotel-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html#REVIEWS

Complimentary fruit and water was served every day. The breakfast was good but very modest compared to the hotel we stayed at in Hoi An.

Apr 2015,"Good for coeliacs, with a nice restaurant on the ground floor too.

We stayed one night at the Serene Hotel in Hue. It is located about 1.5km from the Forbidden Purple Palace (Imperial Citadel), so an easy cab ride or you could just walk.

The hotel is on a bumpy back-street, but the area is safe to walk in at night. The rooms were good, including a bath. An under-sized room safe was a minor annoyance, but the security was good in the hotel.

The staff were friendly, competent and able to give a good recommendation for a boat ride to visit a pagoda out of town for 20USD.

Once more, a firm/hard mattress.
