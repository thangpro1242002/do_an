43891,Having stayed at a sister hotel in Hanoi we had high hopes for this hotel. Some things are good. Mainly the staff who are super friendly and helpful. The position of the Hotel a short walk from the bars and restaurants but not noisy. Now the bad bits. It is very dated. I can only liken the feel of it to when I used to travel around the former soviet states in the early days and you took your own bath plugs. The room we had was large (needlessly so). It had a jacuzzi bath with a hand held shower. I am suspicious of jacuzzi baths as if not regularly cleaned they become pretty putrid. Having run the pump for 20 seconds the stench was unmistakable. Probably not cleaned for months. The hand held shower was stupidly powerful. I mean painfully so. It had no where to hang it on,30,156,"Shoeburyness, United Kingdom",266,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A9328WLsimonw,Simon W,43891,Bit of a shame,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293926-d4357913-Reviews-Hue_Serene_Palace_Hotel-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html

Anyways, in the end it was an exceptional mishap as the night auditor had to step out urgently and wasn't present on my call for complaint.

Room was functional but clean. Bars on the window in our 3rd floor room for security purposes as it backed on to nearby roofs. Housekeeping very eager to get into room of a morning so could have done with Do Not Disturb sign being provided.

Breakfast was fine although maybe could have done with some additional cold meats/cheeses being offered. Ate in the restaurant one night and that was again good.

Location was excellent with all sorts of bars/restaurants within walking distance.

43862,"Hue Serene Palace rooms are spacious, beds are comfy with ample pillows. Good selection for breakfast especially the hot entrees, fruit juices and fresh fruit. Towels could be whiter in colour and shower curtain and bathtub area smells of mildew. You can rent a motorbike from the hotel for a full day or half a day if you want to take a spin around the city or rent one from the place across the street.
There can be heard echoes and noises from the hallway or the floor above you at all hours due to the hard surfaces used, which can be annoying. Elevator is very handy for luggage and I appreciated the 2 free bottles of water per day (previous hotel provided 2 bottles on the first day only).

43770,"The redeeming quality of this hotel is the staff service. We were greeted upon arrival and promptly given some fruit juice and fresh fruit. We arrived early but did not have to wait long until a room was ready for us. We were escorted by a bellman and he showed the various features of the room. The two waitresses in the restaurant at dinner were also very pleasant and delivered prompt service.

The location wasn't ideal. It was tucked away in a back alley - a mile away from the Citadel. We don't mind walking it but for some, it might be a little too far out. The bathroom wasn't the best - the lighting is pretty dim and the caulking in the tub area was terrible. Therefore, it did not feel completely clean. We checked out around 6am and when we walked into the lobby, the overnight shift (bellman and night auditor) were literally sleeping on the couch in the lobby and a thin mattress on the floor. We had to wait for them to wake up and put on their shoes. I understand that this is an independent hotel, but as a traveler who works in the hotel industry, this was disappointing and honestly, a little irritating, especially since we had to be somewhere at a certain time. It is an overnight shift, but that's your shift to be on duty and to be attentive to any and all guest needs.",30,5,NA,3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maianhtran09,maianhtran09,43770,Only good for one night,NA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293926-d4357913-Reviews-or30-Hue_Serene_Palace_Hotel-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html#REVIEWS
43770,"We spent two nights at this hotel in beautiful Hue and the service was impeccable. The staff was beyond friendly and helpful, always greeted us with a smile and went out of their way to make us comfortable. The ladies at the front desk were beyond helpful, making phone calls to set up transport for us and giving us good tips for site seeing. Their restaurant, the Serene Restaurant, has some of the best, if not the best food in Hue. You must have their Bun Bo Hue or the Banana Flower salad, so good! Their restaurant staff is also super friendly and made us feel right at home. The rooms are modern, comfortable, clean and quiet. If your into shopping and nightlife this hotel is only a couple of blocks from the hustle and bustle of Vo Thi Sau street.
We used the hotels car service to get from Da Nang to Hue and back to the Da Nang airport. Our drivers, Minh and Hai were both excellent, safe drivers. They were both kind and accommodating. I would definitely recommend using the hotels car service as they are safe, professional and use late model cars. Our first driver Minh was great, driving us from DAD to My Son, Hoi An, Hi Van Pass over look and always asking to make sure we were comfortable and if we want to stop for pictures. Our driver taking us back to Da Nang, Hai, was very friendly as well and funny. Hai made a two and a half hour ride fun and feel short. He was nice enough to stop and buy us some water and some sweet snacks for the ride. To me it’s the little things that count to make for an excellent experience and these driver definitely did that for us. If you don’t use this car service you’re missing out.

Overall, Hue has become our favorite city. The city has wonderful cultural attributes, and some of the kindest and friendliest people we met while in Vietnam. That’s saying a lot since most everyone in Vietnam is friendly!",50,NA,NA,4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T1129IQcarlosp,Carlos P,43770,Great Hotel,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293926-d4357913-Reviews-or40-Hue_Serene_Palace_Hotel-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html#REVIEWS
43770,"I have been around, living in hotels in many countries and Vietnam, this is the hotel I would stay always, despite being tucked away in a tiny lane and in my opinion, consider this hotel amongst the top I have stayed in. The hotel location is neither urban nor rural because if you sit on the balcony you can hear the frogs sing after a rainy day and the cockerel crowing in the morning, with new buildings sprouting up in the surrounding landscape. (My concern is that Hue might develop too fast and lose the feel of a slightly laid back town to become just another modern town of coffee houses and restaurants and shopping centres.) I often sit at the balcony to meditate as the moon sets and watch the sunrise illuminating the growth progress of the city listening to the sounds of a country side setting.

The hotel ambience is one of a family hotel with a restaurant serving the best food in Hue. The staff here are always very helpful and what is important about hotel customer service, like a 6 star premium hotel, is that they remember customer preferences. They don't use a computer database here, just warm loyal staff who know the guest well.

Even if there are newer and modern hotels in Hue, my choice will always be this hotel. Never have I seen so many loyal guest who would stay for weeks or months. The staff seriously makes the difference and the boss and management of the group should really bear this in mind.

Another great thing about this hotel is the english language fluency of most of the staff , you get what you want when you ask the staff in english. I note that there are front desk staff like Alan who speaks basic Mandarin and I think I overheard him speak a European language, these are the people who would help bridge the communication gaps existing in many Vietnamese hotels. In developing countries, management normally encourage staff with a passion to communicate in another language like this by sponsoring them for language course as it is definitely a competitive advantage for the hotel to have such staff in the growing competition.",50,92,"Singapore, Singapore",513,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeffchia88,jeffchia88,43739,A hotel away from home with high standards of customer service.,NA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293926-d4357913-Reviews-or40-Hue_Serene_Palace_Hotel-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html#REVIEWS

43739,"I had a mixed experience during my stay with Hue Serene Palace Hotel.
Pros: restaurant staff
Cons: driver booked through hotel, WiFi, showerhead

The woman who checked us in was very pushy about having us book a driver through them when we had only just walked in the door. This was after we were mobbed by men as soon as we got off the train to hire them as drivers but we were already warned to only take the white and green taxis in Hue. We had to tell the Serene Palace reception lady more than twice that we needed some time to think about it and she finally backed off. Please chill out and let us enjoy our welcome drinks and fruit without trying to up-sell as soon as we walk in the door. The WiFi was not working while we waited in the lobby and I was told they had some issues with the WiFi but it would work in the room. I was trying to make arrangements while waiting for the room to be ready and when we were allowed in the room the WiFi on the floor did not work. I called the front desk and it eventually worked.

We had a special occasion to celebrate and the staff kindly made swans from towels on the bed and a mini bottle of Vietnamese wine which was very much appreciated. The showerhead didn’t stay at the right angle which was difficult to use but a minor point.

We ate the set menu for dinner at the hotel and everything was delicious and the servers were very attentive. We also had breakfast and they even packed some fruit for us to take on the road. This was the highlight of our stay.

The low point of our experience was that we booked the Serene Palace driver (this is their driver and the car even had giant letters advertising the hotel) to take us to My Son sanctuary and then Hoi An. At $90 USD I thought it was a bit expensive for a driver (not a tour guide). But the hotel told us it was because of the tolls which add up to $15 USD alone. We trusted the hotel and told the driver we only wanted to go to My Son as we already came from Danang and didn’t need to go anywhere else. He said he would only stop if we wanted to stop at places for photos but we told him more than once just go to My Son. At a couple points on the drive we asked how much longer as it was taking us quite a bit longer than expected and we realized he was driving us through Danang. We arrived at My Son not at the expected 2.5 hours, but it took us 4 hours! He ended up taking us on local roads and avoiding some of the toll roads.

No one likes to feel taken advantage of and so I advise caution before booking a driver through Hue Serene Palace Hotel. I am not sure if the driver did this on his own to pocket the extra money but ultimately the hotel needs to stand behind their employees’ behavior.

So one star for the driver, 5 stars for the restaurant, 3 stars for the front desk hustle and I give an average of 2-3 stars for the Hue (Not-so) Serene Palace Hotel.",30,53,"San Francisco, California",28,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tripkey,tripkey,43739,"Great restaurant staff, needs some improvement",NA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293926-d4357913-Reviews-or40-Hue_Serene_Palace_Hotel-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html#REVIEWS

The staff were, to a person, very helpful and friendly. The waitresses in the restaurant were exceptionally nice. No-one tried to sell me on tours etc, for which I was grateful.

Modern hotel , great food and staff very keen to be helpful. Laundry service is very good value ( USD 1 per kilo at time of writing )

Breakfast is very varied and very good. Incredible juices, totally natural and the amount of fruit available.
The location scares a bit, because it is a very narrow street. A little away from the Citadele. But with a taxi (very cheap), in 5 minutes you're there.
I recommend upgrading the amenities. The amount of shower soap that they put for 4 people is fair.

The Hotel lies in the touristy zone, most happening area of the city with lots of dining options. The bus station is little more than 1 Km away while the railway ( Train) station is about 3 Kms away from this hotel. We preferred the Bricks Cafe & Mr. Thinh's Fries nearby. The hotel's restaurant too serves relishing food. Indian cuisine too, is available just 5 minutes walk from the hotel at Shiva Shakti Restaurant, managed by the famous chain - Ganesh Indian Cuisine. The breakfast served by the hotel is awesome with lots of options to choose from.

Not only do they help out with the usual things like tours and flights, but they really seem to take a special interest in each guest. They are very personable.

The rooms were very clean and spacious. The bed was comfortable. If you like having outdoor space, I recommend you upgrade to a balcony room. There is no other outdoor space. The front of the hotel is on an alley with no space for chairs to sit. There is space to sit inside the lobby though.

The restaurant in the hotel is fabulous. It is currently ranked the #1 restaurant in Hue. (At the time of my visit, July, 2019.). It was so good, I didn’t eat anywhere else while in Hue. They have a Hue specialty menu, which I worked my way through, and everything was delicious. I especially liked the item that comes with about 6 little dishes. I can’t remember the name but will attach the picture. Don’t miss this!

In the restaurant, all the staff were super friendly. However, Sally is something special. I caught a cold just before arriving to the hotel, and she made me a special ginger tea with fresh cut ginger, lime and honey. Not only did she do this for me once, but she did it every meal for the 3 days I was there. By the time I left the cold was gone. She takes a special interest in her customers and makes you feel like a friend.

The team at the Hue Serene Palace hotel were incredible, the welcomed us warmly and offered a nice refreshing drink and fruits (Much needed). They managed to sort out our room within 15 minutes of arrival! The beds were comfy rooms very spacious and clean.

Location is right next to the busy streets where there is plenty of street food/shops/restaurants and things to do, whilst also being tucked away in an alleyway making it nice and quiet if you want that!

We were able to hire bikes and explore the city and the staff gave good recommendations. We also organised hiring bikes from the hotel to our next stop on da nang and the staff were great!

Kelly answered when I called from the airport to ask how much I should pay for my taxi and when I arrived to the hotel she took care of my check-in. Kelly took her time to go over the Hue map with me and helped to create my plan for Hue and book my tours. I told her I wanted to go to my room to think about all the options she gave me and she didn’t pressure me into anything, she just told me they would be there when I was ready. The room was a good size and the balcony was a nice touch. I had an awesome view of the city. There was plenty of storage space for unpacking your bags. My only issue with the room was the hand held shower vs the shower being on the wall. The ladies in the restaurant were always pleasant for breakfast. They offered cooked to order options for breakfast and then they had a fruit and bread buffet to go with your entree. The location was great for walking around the town.

43586,"First, I must thank the attentive and friendly staff at Hue Serene Palace Hotel for a very memorable and enjoyable first trip to Hue City, and to Vietnam. This includes the front desk, the housekeepers, the bell boys and separate kitchen waitresses and cooks. The restaurant in the hotel is excellent but a separate business operation so it will be covered in another TripAdvisor report.

Prior to arrival, several emails were exchanged with the hotel staff to arrange for transportation from the airport located a few miles south. When I got off the plane and made my way outside the Phu Bai Airport terminal, private transportation was waiting for me as promised. Off to a good start, I had a great ride into town taking in the sights and taking photos and video clips from the front seat.

The Hue Serene Palace Hotel is located in a busy alley just a block or two from a main thoroughfare which parallels the Perfume River just to the north. I was dropped off in front of the lobby and hotel staff collected my single, handcarry bag. Upon introducing myself to the front desk, I was immediately presented with a plate of fresh, tropical fruits and a juice drink while the hotel staff got me all signed in. They did the work, while all I had to do was relax and enjoy. I noticed right away that the hotel lobby and front desk area was exceptionally clean, modern and stylish. With check in complete, I spoke with Maya (her chosen western name) for several minutes regarding plans for tours of Hue and excursions in the coming days. Maya was very cheerful and helpful in getting everything arranged. She also had a great sense of humor and spoke English very well. I can't emphasize enough how hard everyone worked to make sure I was having the best vacation stay possible.

The room looks exactly like it does in the photos, fresh, clean and exceedingly neat. Everything is up to date and the room itself affords plenty of space to move around. The bedding and linens were excellent and made for a very comfortable place to sleep after spending hours exploring the ancient city and surrounding areas. The hotel also left a fresh plate of fruit in the room every day which was a nice touch. For those who may have left their tablet or laptop at home, each room is equipped with a desktop personal computer with internet connectivity. There was also a small safe located in the room suitable for passports and important travel documents and perhaps a cell phone. The WiFi network in the building had very good speed and I didn't experience any noticeable or significant dropouts. The WiFi was easily good enough to make FaceTime calls with clear video. My room was on the sixth floor but fortunately there is an elevator. My sixth floor room was in the front of the building and with the curtains opened featured a really unique and picturesque view of the surrounding rooftops near the hotel. The room also featured a balcony which I used mostly to take photographs or listen to the sounds of the city at night.

The bathroom was really nice and well maintained, again just as it looks in the photos on the website. A glass shower enclosure with a multiple outlet water delivery, spray, rain or just faucet. The housekeeping staff did as good of a job with keeping the bathroom tidy as they did with the rest of the room.

Lets see, there was also a small refrigerator in the room as well a coffee pot with instant coffee. There was also a large flat screen TV in the room which I watched mostly to fet a feel for local Vietnam programming. The room was fully air conditioned, a necessity for the hot months, but it took a while for the smaller unit to cool the room down. The AC and power shut down once the electronic room key is removed from the wall slot. Despite the minor inconvenience, the room did cool down sufficiently. On a positive note, the noisy A/C compressor was located outside, on the balcony, so the room was very quiet.

My stay in the Hue Serene Palace Hotel was terrific and made for one of the most memorable visits anywhere. The hotel staff deserves special recognition for their awesome guest service.

43586,"Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights. On the night of our arrival we were escorted to our room with a lovely view of the city. The room was quite hot, but we were told it would cool down in a bit. When we returned from dinner, the air conditioner in the room was not really working. It was late and the maintenance team was not available. The bellhop for the hotel came to the room and worked tirelessly to get it working and it did improve slightly. He also brought up a fan to help keep the room cooler that night. The next day the maintenance team fixed the unit and we could sleep the night without issue. So, while initially disappointed, the service at this hotel really did stand out. Considering there was little that was under their direct control, the staff all tried very hard to make up for the shortcomings of our initial night.

We also used the laundry service offered by the hotel, which was brilliant. I had stained a shirt the previous week and tried to remove the stain myself with no luck. I had no expectation that it would be removed by the hotel laundry service. Too my surprise the shirt came back spotless! I would also add that the breakfast that came with the room each day was marvelous. Lots of options. Plenty to eat. So, high marks for that.

When we checked out of the hotel, we had been given a discount for the trouble the air conditioner (or lack of) had caused. So, bonus points for that.

Other good points: Located close to everything - we walked to the Citadel but some may find this a bit too far. Nearby restaurants and bars provide many options as well.

In closing, my only reason for a 4 instead of a 5 is that I think the hotel does need an upgrade, at least in the air conditioning. It was quite an old unit. Even when it was fixed the room remained hotter than expected. Again, this is not something the staff can fix. That will require an owner to invest in some upgrades. So, I do recommend staying here, just be aware that the coolness of your room in the 37 degree heat may be a bit less than you expected.

Hotel is situated on a very narrow street/alley off the main road but location is good as walkable to the river and centre. Given a nice room on the top floor with a balcony (shame it rained and we couldn’t use it!) plenty of space to open suitcases, which can sometimes be an issue in smaller rooms. Would have preferred a walk-in shower rather than the jacuzzi bath but as it was only for two nights, coped ok. Didn’t experience any noise issues. Good wi-fi.
Restaurant and its staff very good and we enjoyed some nice meals and breakfasts there. Offers on various things throughout the day (we enjoyed free tomato salad with lunch).
Organised a City Tour through them to the Citadel, boat trip etc, which was good.
Note: for those with mobility issues, there is a flight of steps leading up to the hotel.

The room was bigger than I thought it would be which is always a nice surprise and a bonus, and it was kept very clean throughout my entire stay. The rooms are spacious and comfortable and the beds are very soft. The price of the hotel is excellent considering what is included - breakfast every morning was delicious. There is so much to choose from and a small buffet or fruit, cereals, pastries and bread which you can help yourself to throughout the morning.

They really look after you best they can and make sure your stay in boyh Hué and the hotel is enjoyable and comfortable, which it truly was! Nice sized lobby with a little ”pond” with fish in, sophisticated restaurant with AMAZING breakfast (lots to choose from) and the rooms were beautiful! Spacious and clean, even had a computer in it!

I’ve seen some reviews saying beds were hard and/or loud but this wasn’t my experience at all. I found the bed to be perfectly soft, the pillow was awesome and the AirCon was hardly audible in QuietMode. Often the shower is somewhat questionable in terms of heat and power of the jets but not here! Spacious shower with glass walls/door, very efficient and comfortable jets! Had to fiddle slightly with getting the right temperature but we did eventually! I don’t know how the rooms are different but we were in 405 and have no complaints!

43497,"It’s not often we are torn on a hotel review - but we are this time. Usually it’s either very good or very bad or simply indifferent. This time we are torn because the staff of the Hue Serene Palace are by far the best thing about the hotel. In fact, they make up all the good things about the hotel. They are friendly, helpful, eager to please, professional and they make a good breakfast. However, a hotel stay is a summation of many things - not just efficient bell boys and friendly staff on the front desk (hello to Alan, Maya, Kelly and Julia). The price is good in comparison to Vietnamese hotel pricing generally. There is good bang for buck. The hotel is consistently spotless, the housekeeping staff are excellent. The cleanliness is aided by the hard surfaces, tiles etc, everywhere. BUT - and I hate for there to be a but as the staff really have tried to make our stay in Hue wonderful and kudos to them for that. BUT - The most important thing for us in a hotel is the quality of sleep - defined by the comfort of the beds and the soundproofing of the property. The linens on the bed were fine - clean, white cotton, nice weight of quilt/duvet/doona - cosy with the Air Con on. However the bed bases are just hollow plywood boxes placed directly on the hard surface floor. Every move makes a loud noise. Every roll, every turn and we can only imagine how that noise transmits to the floors below. The mattresses are also hard. Not firm, not comfortable, not ‘could be better’ - they are hard. So hard, the hotel has already added 2 mattress toppers to them and a mattress protector on top of that. Still hard, even with all the glitter. Also, it’s a sad fact of life that mildew is a fact of life in Asia - but the bed in 501, closest to the door, also has a strong mildew whiff to it (but it’s sitting on a wooden box, so can’t ventilate so understandable). We came to this hotel because reviews said the beds were comfortable - but going forward we will discount any reviewers from anywhere in Asia as the concept is somewhat different to western travellers. Right - so that’s the first half of sleep quality - not good, in fact terrible. The second half of sleep quality is soundproofing. There isn’t any. The room we were in initially had someone either repeatedly vomiting or hoicking and coughing in a death-defying manner in the room above. Our first room also had a mildewy/fausty smell which didn’t clear even with the Air Con used and the very small window opened (note.... avoid the standard rooms. Often called ‘Superior’ on the booking sites... whatever the base level room is... just don’t - in particular Room 503). Right - the hoicking/vomiting/coughing...above us, repeatedly. In graphic detail. The walk to the loo - the clomping back, the scraping of furniture, the return trip, the flushing... first evening 3 times? and first morning - all over again. The hotel very kindly shifted us to another room - which was a significant upgrade and we are of course very grateful for that. It doesn’t solve the major soundproofing issues in a building seemingly not built for purpose. Water can be heard running/flushing/draining most of the time. Someone in the room above us on our final night of 4 nights decided to either jump up and down on the bed - or do exercise - possibly skipping - for an hour or so in the evening and again the next morning. Like bass music, without the music. The man next door has a bad cough, the housekeeping are doing their thing, the doors slam by default and the electronic locks are dicky - that’s a tech term for beeping repeatedly and annoyingly, but only sometimes, when you open the door and hold it open for a minute or so - like when a couple are leaving a room gradually. It’s a function of the standard of guest staying here, but also of the hotel build that people allow their children to run around the common areas and play in the stairwell and squeal - and there is a very large internal stairwell so the sound travels, very well - especially when they play the running up and down and sqealing game. There’s little to be done about all the noise and the staff seem to work so hard and be friendly to make up for the hotel’s shortcomings.

Finally - can anything be done? Carpet isn’t practical, but perhaps under the box base beds a thick felt mat could absorb the noise. The mattresses are probably fine for Asian guests who seem to have a cultural preference for very firm/hard. But the ones that are already mildewed or are seriously worn out with the dreaded ‘hole in the middle’ hollow feeling from extensive commercial use need to replaced and it should be done with soft mattresses - available to guests with a preference for soft/padded/comfortable. The use of regular ensemble bases found in most hotels with felt pads on the feet could be adopted along with the new mattresses. As to the rest of the soundproofing issues - a technical check of the doors for low battery levels could at least minimise the pesky beeping - on average 3 times a day/any time of the day or night (that was other people on our floor) - and thankfully only once our door decided to do it.

How to cope? As with any challenges - a sleep mask, ear plugs, a sleeping pill and, ideally a strong gin and tonic. Fine every night. But highly impractical during the day when you might want to spend some quiet time in your room after a big day out exploring all Hue has to offer. So if you like a good price, a hard mattress and sleep like the dead - crack on, this is the hotel for you. If you feel like the walking dead after multiple nights of bad sleep, this hotel might not be for you. We reiterate the staff are doing everything they can - 1000% but it was like flying long haul for 4 days strapped into the middle seat of the middle row, next to the toilets. Albeit with business class food and service and wonderful staff. A real hard product / soft product dilemma. If it weren’t for the staff we would have only given 1 or at most 2 Tripadvisor bubbles - because when it comes down to it, for us, a hotel is there for sleeping - itdoesn't matter how pretty the room is, how nice the picture on the wall is or how sweet the staff are...

The hotel has its own restaurant and the employees are just amazing. They will go out of their way to make your stay as unforgettable as possible. They are also smiling all the time; they are very considerate and extremely kind indeed.

All the waitresses were outstanding, and one of them stood out even more. Her name is Selena, she seriously has a golden heart, and I can say that the restaurant is very lucky to have her, she is a gem.

One of the more kind-hearted person I have met so far during this trip. She made me feel just like home and even more. I thank you ever so much for it, you’re the best :).

Now, regarding the hotel facilities; the hotel is very clean and the rooms are spacious, neat and nicely decorated, the mattress is very comfortable and so are the pillows.

You need to be close, but maybe not too close, to the buzzing bar and restaurant district centred on the junction of Vo Thi Sau and Chu Van An which is pedestrianised at the weekends. This area is packed through the evening with tourists and locals of all ages (a sort of dressed-up Vietnamese passeggiata). Unmissable. Halloween made this even more fun for us, which seems to be quite a thing here, however culturally incongruous. But the number of live bands and street acts will make you glad you are sleeping a block or two away.

A geriatric PC in the room, presumably for browsing and email, was an unusual touch and provided a nice trip down memory lane.

43374,"Before going to Serene Palace earlier this year I've never really had feelings about the concept of service in the context of hotels. I couldn't really tell hotels apart on the parameter and I didn't know what service should mean. I thought of hotels as short term apartment rentals and all I expected was a key to a nice room. Other than that, I would expect to be on my own. But Serene Palace helped me to understand and appreciate hospitality.

During my 3 week trip with my family, we stayed at 6 different hotels ranging from 3 star to 5 star. Serene Palace was the cheapest, but through my 3 day stay they established themselves as the service reference that other hotels must be compared against.

When we arrived by taxi, the staff immediately rushed down to pick up our luggage. They led us into the lobby, where they immediately started to do the check-in work. No waiting. They didn't make us stand up in front of the desk, but instead encouraged us to sit at a couch setup next to the reception area where another staff member immediately served us fresh fruit.

After a quick check-in, we went to our rooms. They were clean and large rooms. Fairly standard. An unusual amenity was the presence of a (dated) internet-connected PC in the room allowing for web browsing. Helpful if you haven't brought along your own iPad or laptop. The WiFi was stable and reliable. My only complaint with the room would be the acoustics. Sound ripples through the construction, so if your neighbors are noisy, you are more likely to know than in other hotels. However, considering the cost and the other pros, I feel this is forgivable.

We've all experienced workers who sends you a negative vibe. Makes you feel unwanted and feel like they are put in their job against their will. If you consider a spectrum of staff commitment with the left side meaning total indifference and the right side being obsessive staff, this hotel is leaning towards the right side, but not to the point where it becomes creepy and/or annoying. They are attentive, but respectful.

One evening we were eating in the restaurant and my aunt didn't finish her plate. There was nothing wrong with her food, but she wasn't feeling well. The waiter noticed this and politely asked. The waiter offered her complimentary ginger tea and when we got the bill, the waiter removed the charge for my aunts food (we did not ask for a discount - she just decided to give it). That tea was just what she needed. In the morning, the staff recognised my aunt, asked if she slept well and again brought her ginger tea together with her breakfast. This gesture made us feel like our visit was (very) appreciated.

Several times during our stay, Allan in the reception would greet us on the way out or into the hotel and ask if we would like ideas on what to see or where to eat. He would listen to our concerns and ideas and provide meaningful suggestions on where to go. I know that the hotel may get commission for their recommendations, but I have no problem with that when their recommendations are great. And that was the case here. When we needed taxis, the reception would get one right away. Whenever we returned from the city to the hotel, the reception would come running to greet us and open the door.

At one point, one of us forgot the pin code for the safe. We called the reception and within minutes they were there with a master key to reset the safe. No charge for that, even though it was our own fault.

During our stay, we asked Allan in the reception about transport to Hoi An and he listened to our requirements, quickly and clearly presented us with different options and weighed in with pros and cons. Ultimately, he arranged and confirmed for us to rent a big private minibus (15 seats) for a day with stops at different landmarks/tourist attractions during the trip. And this was with 2 days notice. I think we paid around 120 USD for the service, which he put on the hotel bill. IMHO, it was a comfortable and affordable transfer to Hoi An.

In summary, the staff is great and they will help you out whenever you need it - even when you don't know that you need it.

If I go back to Hue, I would be very likely to stay here again.",50,17,NA,8,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/709nielsb,Niels B,43221,Exceptional value,Trip type: Traveled with family,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293926-d4357913-Reviews-or240-Hue_Serene_Palace_Hotel-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html#REVIEWS

As you walk in, the staff makes sure to make you feel welcome, take care of your luggage and lets you relax for a few minutes while they sort the room out. During that time, they brought us a plate with different kind of fruts and offered us coffee too. The staff is very helpful and goes with you over a map of Hue and its main attractions, giving their personal advice on what to do according to your stay length. The room was great, spcious and clean. The hotel restaurant, where we ate breakfast, was also great. There is a menu with different items, to which you can order as many as you want for breakfast and they are cooked instantly.

The hotel also offered us service to rent motorbikes and do the Hai Van Pass (which goes from Hue to Danang/Hoi An). The prices were really good and motorbikes were in great conditions. The person from the motorbike service comes to the hotel, goes over important info with you, gets your phone number and take your bags which are dropped at your destination in Danang/Hoi An area (all included in the price). This was the most helpful service at Hue Serene Palace.

The location of the hotel is also good, near the bar street area yet in a thin street with no loud sounds at all. The nightly price also makes this hotel excellent value, top service for a budget!

43282,"Hue Serene Palace Hotel is your standard build Vietnamese hotel. We stayed in a 2 double bedroom and it provided sufficient room for our family over the 3 days in Hue. I got out at Hue airport and paid about 160K VND for a taxi to the airport. Make sure you have your addresses handed as driver’s may not know English well.

Whilst arriving at the hotel you feel it is off the main street and away from the action. Most of the action in this area hots up at night time. There’s currently stormwater and sewerage piping being re done so part of the street is blocked off.

When we arrived we were greeted by friendly hotel staff, welcome fruits and drinks which was really appreciated. Toiletries are basic and the hotel bathroom is respectable.

Infrastructure wise they have the standard local plugs which can fit Australian 2 pin chargers or Thailand, Taiwan or Indonesian electrical points. It won’t fit HK, Malaysia or Singapore chargers. Bottled water is provided for each person and there’s a computer in the room with chairs to sit at.

We had another double bedroom for 2 people and that was a very ample and spacious size.

In all the hotel was kept clean and worth staying at because of the location. I liked how it was not located on the walking street because once the roads are closed, you can’t drive in and out by taxi. So if you arrive or depart during the walking street time, it’s a struggle.

The only problem is sound proofing between rooms is poor and rowdy neighbours blasting a TV can mean less sleep or interrupted early mornings

Right now, the Hue Night Market isn’t really functioning and just a mere couple of stalls. What’s great is the hotel is adjacent to the Walking Street market in Vo Thi Sau, from Friday night 6pm -10pm and repeated over Saturday and Sunday. So having not been to Hue before, it was a nice surprise that we were so close to the action and the atmosphere. There’s plenty of restaurants and small stalls to buy food from and the street sellers had food that was edible for western tummies.

I also arranged a DMZ tour with the hotel and they arranged a tour guide who was a local from the area to the Vinh Moc tunnels for $100USD. Because the guide was a local who survived the war it was well worth it and more enjoyable experience. Passing the Ben Hai river was also The only thing I would completely by pass is the

I had arranged a city tour separately with another company for $50USD.

After several e-mails between us and I was told the items were too valuable to post, so I made arrangements to collect them. On arrival I was welcomed and the items returned.

43221,"On April 25, 2018 my wife and I checked into this hotel for 2 nights accompanied by two other couples. On arrival we found that the entire single lane street had been dug up and was a horrible mud pit! Our driver would not take his car down the street and we had to get the hotel porters to carry our luggage 50 metres to the hotel while we traipsed through the mud to the hotel lobby. Not a good start. On 27 April we checked out at 9.30 am and forgot to retrieve our Australian passports, credit cards, cash and my wife's diamond ring from our room number 402 safe. While we sat in the downstairs lobby waiting for our driver to arrive, the cleaners advised Mary, the desk manager that the safe was still locked. She despatched the bellboy with the master key. He entered the room alone at 9.54 am (before we departed at 10.00 am) and unlocked the safe. Around midday we realised we had forgotten to retrieve our passports etc. and phoned the hotel. Mary, the desk manager told us on that phone call that the safe was empty when opened by the bellboy so we returned to the hotel to file police reports etc. We now believe that the bellboy was telling the truth. In fact we strongly suspect that the theft was orchestrated by the hotel desk manager, Alan Tran who welcomed us on April 25. I was the only Caucasian present in our group of 6 and Alan was emphatic that my Asian wife and I occupy room 402. Room 402 shared a balcony on the 4th floor with room 401 where our Malaysian friends were placed. Alan also explained that Hue was very safe and that it was safe to walk around and safe to lock our valuables in the room safes. Room 402 had NO INSTRUCTIONS for setting the room safe combination so I had to ask Alan Tran to come up to the room to show me how to set the combination. My wife saw him looking under my arm pit as I set my combination and locked my money belt with passport inside the safe. Alan then remained in the room chatting with me for about 5 more minutes. He told me he was early 30's and earned US$200 per month as did his wife. They have 2 young children. According to him, a home in Hue costs US$30,000 to $40,000 and he has no chance of ever owning his own home. I spoke of Samsung's huge investments in Vietnam and he complained bitterly that they were just raping his country and sending all the profits back to Korea. He seemed to be a very bitter young man. As he left, he said he would be off work the following day but would be on the desk the next morning when we checked out. That night I opened the safe and locked up my wife's money pouch containing her passport and valuables. At the time of making my police statement, I thought I had opened the safe the next day but in fact I was upset, confused and wrong in that part of my police statement. I only opened the safe once and that was when I put my wife's pouch in the safe. The next day we were all out till mid afternoon when I returned alone for a rest. After a while I noticed the room was quite hot even though the air conditioner was turned on. I looked behind the curtains and saw that the balcony door was wide open. I thought nothing of this and closed and locked it but did mention this to my wife when she returned a few hours later. The balcony is shared with the adjoining room 401 where our friends were staying but is on the 4th floor facing the street. You would need to be spider man to climb onto it! The morning we checked out, Alan Tran was NOT working. He had phoned in and changed his shift to the evening, citing ""family matters"". Note that a CCTV camera is recording every entry to our room 24/7. We think that Alan may have passed the safe combination to one of the 4 cleaners who work as a team cleaning the rooms together. This cleaner then unlocked our balcony door on the morning of April 26 then moved with the cleaning team to the adjoining room number 401 and went out alone to clean their balcony, quickly entering our room 402 through the unlocked balcony door, opening the safe and stealing its contents then returning unseen to room 401, deliberately leaving the balcony door wide open to make it look like an outside job. This would have avoided the CCTV camera looking at the entry to room 402. A stolen Australian passport can be sold for a large sum on the black market. If it was Alan, then he got his house. I hope his children will be proud of him. When the police attended on 27th April, the desk manager Mary, accompanied by the hotel manager, acted as our interpreter both with the police in the room and then at the office of the immigration police. They both seemed very keen for us to leave town, telling us that it we would have to stay till late the next week to get a stamped and signed copy of the police report itemising our lost valuables (cash, credit cards and jewellery). The immigration police officer got angry with us and thumped the table with his hand when we tried to write the word ""stolen"" on our statement. He slapped a new form down in front of my wife and then in front of me and insisted through Mary, the hotel interpreter that we write the word ""lost"" when referring to our passports. We felt quite intimidated by him and he then left the office at 4.45 pm and we were told there was no one available to stamp and sign our statements about ""losing"" our passports. We knew by then that we needed these signed and stamped statements to be able to obtain an exit visa to leave Vietnam. We chose to leave Hue and drive back to Da Nang when Mary assured us that she would get the statements stamped and signed the next day. In fact Mary sent photos of the signed and stamped statements via whatsapp to us that evening after we arrived in Da Nang, claiming that she found another immigration office opened to sign them. The Serene Palace Hotel then sent the originals to us in Da Nang by private car the next morning at their expense. We felt that we had been manipulated into leaving Hue and that the hotel management wanted to get rid of us as soon as possible. We have never received official police copies of our report itemising the stolen valuables but did managed to take photos of the statements we wrote for the investigating police whilst seated in room 402. All up, it took 12 more days before we could leave Vietnam. We had to obtain travel documents from Vietnam Immigration to allow us to fly to Ho Chi Minh where we applied for emergency passports from the Australian Consulate, exit visas from Vietnam immigration and entry visas back to Malaysia where we had left our Australian house keys and other items in our holiday apartment in Kuala Lumpur. Furthermore I became very ill in Ho Chi Minh and was briefly hospitalised, losing 4 kg of weight by the time I recovered in time to fly out. All up, our 2 night stay at Serene Palace Hotel managed to turn our 6 day holiday into an 18 day nightmare.",10,10,"Perth, Australia",13,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/askmeaboutwa,askmeaboutwa,43191,Beware.

43221,"Don't be put off by the street (really an alley): yes, it's muddy and in terrible condition, but Serene Palace is simply an oasis! (And, apparently, the street is due to be repaired).

I don't have enough superlatives to describe this hotel!! It is immaculate, and very welcoming. They have a full bank of smiling staff to help you with anything you might need, and each and every one of them is very kind, service-oriented and speaks English very well.
Sarah, Sallie, Jack and the rest of the staff were so wonderful.

The hotel happens to be just around the corner from the prime bar and restaurant area, where they close off 5 streets to traffic every evening (a welcome reprieve from the scooters!!), and you can wander and people watch for hours.
However, despite being so close to this boisterous area, it was utterly without noise from both inside and outside the hotel, something that I only experienced here. It is also within easy walking distance from the Citadel.

After being greeted with lemonade and fresh fruit upon arrival, in the room I found real rose petals on my bed, a fridge that worked well, cable TV, a computer (!), a coffee pot and fresh fruit, a counter in the bathroom to put toiletries on (rare in Vietnam), an umbrella on the back of the door (very thoughtful!) and, for the first time, READING lights!!

There is only one thing that I would change: brighter ceiling lights in the room would be welcome.
That said, I would never consider staying anywhere else when I return to Hue. This was the best hotel I stayed in in Vietnam.

43221,"We stayed for two nights at the Hue Serene Palace. Originally we booked the Superior Room which is nicely and with a look for details decorated and with e.g. a computer useful equipped (especially during longer travels). However, the hotel has per floor one room (the Superior Room, Room Nr. 3) in the middle of the floor and those rooms only have windows to the hallway. From the pictures it is not clear, that the Superior Room has no real window and especially room 303 is due to the windows to the hallway (which is all the way to the dining room two floors down open) still quite noisy.

At our first night they had no other rooms free but at the next morning we explained once again the situation (no real window and really noisy) to the restaurant manager Sally and she ensured that we would get another room. With Sallys help we got for our second night the Deluxe Room without additional charge, which was really nice and also quiet. But in order to have a nice stay during both nights it would have been better if the hotel would have written us, that the Superior Room is not a quiet room (for what we precisely asked in our booking).

We could therefore recommend not to book the Superior Room but rather the Junior or Deluxe Room (at least if you want a window). The rooms with the number 1, 2, 4 and 5 are at the end of the floor and with a window and only the rooms number 3 are in the middle.

Before we booked we were a little bit worried about the comments regarding to try to sell tours to guest. In our case the ladies at the reception told us about the tours only once and when we told them, that we want to do it by ourselves it was no problem and we weren't asked again. Beside this the service at the reception is nice, and especially Sally is (as already mentioned) highly motivated and incredible friendly.

On arrival we got not only a fresh juice as welcome drinks but also a tasty fruit salad. The restaurant is in general really nice, we had the best fresh springs rolls all over Vietnam, wonderful vegan vegetable Pho and a great breakfast. On the buffet they have various fresh juices, bread, sweets etc. In addition you can order lots of things such as pancakes, eggs, soups etc.

We had the same driver the next day to visit 3 of the emperors tombs. The hotel manager advised us to go in the morning as the majority of the tour buses do the Citadel in the morning and the tombs in the afternoon. He was so right! The first tomb was so peaceful and then it got more and more busy! The manager also booked a private dragon boat trip along the Perfume river down to the Thien Mu pagoda which was well worth a 30 min stop. The boat waited for us and then dropped us off at the Citadel on the way back. Given we only had 1 clear day in Hue that was about the right length for a boat trip and made a nice break in between pagodas and temples! Just be aware however that the boats are usually ran by a family and this is their livelihood, so while on board they will try to sell you some souvenirs and stuff, so take some small notes with you.

The standout for the hotel is the staff, they're all so helpful and friendly, and everyone we spoke to spoke great English.

Location wise it's a short walk to the river and about a 35 min walk to the citadel.

Based on the staff and the low cost of the rooms, I'd definitely recommend if you're stopping over in Hue.",50,18,"Bristol, United Kingdom",98,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spaceboy250,Paul F,43191,Hotel staff are great,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293926-d4357913-Reviews-or340-Hue_Serene_Palace_Hotel-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html#REVIEWS

The location was great. It was close the the night life with 5 minute walk. It is a little hard to find as it is down a narrow alleyway. Absolutely safe, as you walk down the alleyway there are other hotels, hostel and restaurants and tour guide shops. The location offers a quiet and calm atmosphere and a day or so of exploring the city and sights.

The staff was extremely helpful and very nice. Rooms are clean. The bed was very comfortable. There was complimentary water inside the room. The bathroom was very clean. Hot water was not an issue. There was a free wifi. They had in-house laundry service. There was also a mini fridge and a room safe.

The breakfast was included and different options. Vietnamese and Western Style. I had both styles while I was there.

43132,"Stayed at Hue Serene Palace Hotel with my parents in Feb 2018. It was indeed the best hotel I’ve stayed at!

We booked the hotel’s car service from Da nang airport to Hue. The driver who picked us up was very friendly, spoke very good English, very knowledgeable about the history of Vietnam. We had an excellent drive from Da nang to Hue. We had pre-arranged for the driver to stop at certain places of interest otw to Hue and the driver was very good, took us to the best stops, explained the history of the places and was very patient. Didn’t get his name though, but he deserves a rating of 12/10!

The location of the hotel is slightly off the main road, which is good. The receptionist are very friendly, speaks good English and there was welcome fruits and drinks. :)

We stayed on the 7’th floor, the room was very big, clean and has modern toilet facilities. Best thing is the room had a computer in it! Which was really amazing, even the 5* hotels in London don’t have a computer in the room! There’s also complimentary fruits given everyday.

Breakfast at the hotel is amazing. Again it beats the 5* hotels in London, Australia and etc. You can choose an array of food from the menu which taste amazing!

However, don’t opt for the tour packages offered by the hotel at the reception, it’s really very pricey and they are not really honest about prices. Do grab a taxi from the streets yourself or do your own research.

Overall we had a good stay at Serene Palace Hotel and will definitely recommend it to all travellers.",50,48,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",20,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/itscuddles,itscuddles,43132,Deserves a rating of 12/10,Trip type: Traveled with family,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293926-d4357913-Reviews-or390-Hue_Serene_Palace_Hotel-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html#REVIEWS

43101,"My friend and I stayed at Serene for one rushed night (flights delays etc) in January and it was very pleasant. The staff were welcoming and friendly. Our twin room was huge with two double beds and a bath tub. Amenities and breakfast were great. We also ordered a tuna salad from the restaurant, made to go, and it was really yummy.

The hotel is about a 25 minute walk or cheap cab to the Citadel entrance. The front desk can arrange anything you want. We decided to get a private car to Hoi An, arranged by the hotel which was an incredible experience. I recommended it. It was $60 for the car regardless of the amount of ppl and by the time you catch the train to Da Nang ($19) and take a take to Hoi An ($20) the car is worth the price because our driver stopped at multiple places on the way.

Would highly recommend taking a personal tour over a group one as you can time your own our pace. Hue is the old capital of Vietnam so there is lot of history in those tombs and pagodas that you will visit. Highly recommend our tour guide Mr Hue (check for him at Serene reception). Breakfast was very good too. Not a lot of options but whatever was there was just right to fill you up before you embark on your day journey. We also booked transfer to Hoi An from the hotel. The driver spoke good english and waited for us patiently while we visited a lot of places on the trip.

43101,"You would never choose this hotel from the outside – it’s on a muddy, crumbling street that looks like a back alley, and the front of the building doesn’t make much of an impression – but inside we found a very clean, modern and lovely hotel with excellent service at a good price.

Alan at the front desk was especially helpful with arranging travel plans and tour packages, including private tours of the Citadel, Thien Mu Pagoda, Minh Mang and Khai Dinh Tombs, as well as the DMZ and Vinh Moc tunnels. And Sally in the restaurant was incredibly sweet, bringing us food to take with us on our tours when she felt we didn’t eat enough for breakfast!

The bed was huge and comfortable, and the bathroom was large, with plenty of storage room. Towels, robes and sheets were all plush and high-quality. There was a nice jacuzzi tub but no shower – apparently the rooms have either a tub or a shower, but not both. Inside the beautiful room was a computer for guest use, as well as a refrigerator and small safe. The WiFi worked everywhere and the TV had plenty of channels, including CNN.

43101,"I had written the review once and then realised that I had been too harsh. Thus I decided to revise my review and here I am

Location - It's on a nondescript lane which has just enough space for one vehicle at a time. Not a very good first feel. Lot of eateries within a short walk. Perfume river flows close by. Reaching there was no issue as the Taxi from the Airport took us straight without any hassle

Front Desk - Efficient. All the ladies willing to help with their workable English. They guided us with whenever we asked something - be it with tourist attraction, money exchange, travel booking et al. They were also extremely helpful to connect us with our bus driver when we had got separated inside the Bach Ma National Park

Lift - Only one lift which becomes kind of rush during peak hours. Not a big deal though

Room - We had booked a family room. Spacious enough for a family of 4. Two large and comfortable beds. Very clean. A little short on furnitures Also, the balcony is of little use as it oversees the same small lane

Sleep Quality - Being off the main road, it becomes very quiet and one can enjoy a good night's sleep. The hotel can consider upgrading their pillows

Bathroom - Large bathroom with different rooms having either bath tub or shower area. Overall quite clean but there was some room for improvement

Breakfast - Limited Menu. Only Breads and fruits on the spread. Rest made to order. This can be a hassle during rush hours but the food is served hot and it is very tasty. We really enjoyed the noodle soup and seafood fried rice. Eggs were made to order

Restaurant - Small restaurant at the lobby level - same place where breakfast is served. Though they boasted of 1-for-1 cocktails, the cocktail maker can do with some training. The restaurant closes at 10 PM

Travel Desk - They provide all kinds of travel arrangement. We decided quite late on the tour to Bach Ma National park and they could still arrange that for the next day morning. They can even book the train tickets (albeit for a small premium). However, we chose to book our tickets from the station. The girls at the travel desk and reception were ever willing to help. At one point I thought that they were over insistent on selling their travel packages (city tour, river cruise etc) rather than paying attention to what we wanted - but perhaps that was because of the language issue - persistent all through Vietnam.

Laundry - The hotel laundry has a fantastic rate of USD2 per Kg and returns within 12 hours. I have never got such a good price in any hotel

Overall - A small hotel with a lot of personal touch put in by the staff. A little pricey in my case when I compared my stay in Danang.",40,98,"Singapore, Singapore",166,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abaner,abaner,43070,Nice Stay,Trip type: Traveled with family,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293926-d4357913-Reviews-or430-Hue_Serene_Palace_Hotel-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html#REVIEWS

The room was large and well appointed - bed, bathroom - all comfortable, clean, in working order. Also, quiet room as the hotel is in a small alley. Why only 4 stars? Because the hotel has the charm of an airport holiday inn. This was not helped by the fact that we came and left under pouring rain. Very depressing weather.

Staff were excellent from check-in to checkout, giving map, recommendations, and arranging everything for us to make our stay comfortable and enjoyable. Even if the weather didn't cooperate with us (it was rainy when we were in Hue), we still enjoyed our stay because of the staff!

Car Service: We arranged for two-way car service from and to the airport ahead of time. Emailed the staff our arrival and departure details and everything was arranged in time. One-way car service is $15 and roundtrip is $30, so there's no reason not to get it.

Check-in: Check-in was done seamlessly with welcome fruits and drinks. Maps were provided and a 10% discount coupon on their restaurant was given to us for lunch and dinner (which is the #2 Best Restaurant in Hue!)

Room: Room we booked was at the top floor with a balcony at only $48 which already included breakfast! It has a great view of Hue and the room was spacious with thoughtful Vietnamese art and decor. There's also a private desktop computer in the room, which was very helpful for checking in with our next flight. Bathroom is spacious with adequate amenities and warm water for shower. There's a bidet in the toilet, which is one of the things we wish all hotels would have. There's a welcome fruits and small bottle of wine waiting for us in the room.

Checkout: Checkout was fast and the staff at the restaurant gave us a parting gift of food to take to the airport!

Service: Staff service is most commendable. All staff were great from the receptionist to the wait staff in the restaurant.

Breakfast: Small buffet spread of pastries and coffee plus you can choose any from their breakfast menu. We were so stuffed.

The real stars of the hotel however are the staff. All very friendly and helpful. Special thanks to Jack the bell-boy who came to meet us at the train station and to Si on reception who was so helpful with suggestions on Hue and assisted in our onward travel planning in Vietnam. Of course a big mention to Sally and her team in the dining room. Everyone was so friendly and the breakfasts were wonderful. There is a buffet section and also a choice from the menu if you'd like eggs, Pho, or pancakes etc. I tried them all over the course of our visit and all were beautifully prepared.

1. All the staff made an effort to talk and assist you, whether is it the bellboys, front desk attendants or waitresses in the restaurant. It makes the stay a truly homely one.
2. Room is rather spacious with basic necessities.
3. Breakfast was sumptuous and all you can eat from the menu. Love the wide range of fruits.
4. 1-1 drinks are really value for money.
5. Complimentary fruits everyday, ready in room.

Cons:
1. Located in the back alley. Bigger cars are unable to drive in and drop you off.
2. Additional roll-out bed and pillows are not so comfortable.
3. Trip arrangement by hotel seems a little on the pricier side.

The breakfast was wonderful, they had the basics such as fruit, bread, juice, cakes etc. laid out buffet style and you order eggs, bacon etc.

The location of hotel is down a small alleyway, but don't let this put you off, come out of hotel and turn left walk down to end of alley and then turn right and you are right in the thick of it, and in the new Walking Street area, heaps of fantastic restaurants and shops.

The staff are exceptionally helpful and were able to book us in for a nice tour going around all of the main attractions of Hue at a fair price. We stayed 3 nights and found the rooms to be clean and tidy, with the staff super courtious and friendly (especially everyone at the main reception desk and the lovely pregnant lady from the restaurant).

Reasoning behind the 4 stars is due to the AC in our room not working after several hours of it running. We went down to reception at that night, and the doorman came up and had a look at it for us. He agreed that it wasn't working after playing with the remote for 5 minutes, and left (we assumed to check for another room). He never came back! Went down to the reception again after packing our bags and they switched us to another room. New room was nice but we only were able to stay in it for one night, before we had to switch back to our existing one. Fortunately the AC was fixed for that night (It is super humid in Hue).

42979,"If you are looking for a great value hotel in Hue, look no further that the Serene Palace.

First and foremost, the service here is second to none. We spent 2 weeks in Vietnam in a number of hotels, and the service we received here from all of the staff was head and shoulders above - in a country with such outstanding service I hope this is the greatest compliment I can give! The staff seem genuinely interested in helping you make the most out of your stay, and will do whatever they can to be of assistance.
Communication is great - we emailed in advance and were offered a room upgrade, and replies were very prompt. The airport shuttle service was superb and efficient, with a very friendly driver and a comfortable car, complete with travel guides on the back seats! A nice touch.
The location is great - a little tricky to find down a narrow alley, but just a short walk to the central area of Hue and the main restaurants and bars.
The hotel lobby is very typical of Vietnam - meticulously clean and spacious. The room itself was very large and well presented, with nice touches such as rose petals on the bed. There was complimentary food and bottled water each day. The only comments for improvements that I would make for the rooms are to include an option for a standing shower, and also to have double beds and duvets for double rooms - our bed was two singles pushed together, complete with two single duvets! Not much of an issue but worth mentioning.
Breakfast was good - lots of choice as well as being able to order whatever you liked fresh from the menu, from eggs to pancakes.
The restaurant itself was also great in the evenings, and a perfect option if you are tired from a long day and don't want to leave the hotel.

Hue is also a much smaller city so there is no Uber or Grab and it was very difficult to get a taxi (we only use the Mai Linh of Vinasun companies) when going around town. However, when leaving from the hotel, the staff can always call a taxi for you. They also arranged for a car to drive us down to Hoi An. It cost about $65USD and we could take as long as we wanted on the journey so we could stop by some beautiful places like Lang Co beach, Hai Van Pass, and Marble Mountain.

Large bathrooms too - some bedrooms only have a large shower and others have a bath with a shower in it - so do specify which you would prefer.
Breakfast is a treat - eggs anyway you want and perfectly cooked - lots of fresh fruits and lovely baguette bread.

Our flight from Hanoi was massively delayed but the hotel airport pickup that we had arranged waited for us for nearly 4 hours without complaint. At the hotel upon check-in we were upgraded to a Superior room with a balcony overlooking the quaint streets of the Colonial Quarter. The check in process itself was delightful, with complimentary fresh watermelon juice and fruit - some of the best I've had yet in Vietnam. The room itself was wonderfully equipped with complimentary toiletries, water, fruit, bathrobes, and slippers. The free breakfast was also very nice indeed although the buffet could do with a few more choices - still, Hue is a small town and the hotel did their best.

The room we had was spacious, fresh fruit was provided daily and the room was always very clear! The wood floors and the somewhat thin walls do not help with noise cancellation so depending on how considerate your room neighbours are, you might hear one thing or another, but it was never really bothersome.

42826,"This was a really modern and lovely hotel and the staff were so helpful and friendly and always extremely cheerful. The room was huge, comfortable, and had a balcony. The breakfast was excellent (a la carte, plus a fruit buffet) with a range of Vietnamese food and also some western options. I think we paid about $45 for our room which seems excellent value. I read a couple of reviews on Tripadvisor cautioning that the hotel was located down a 'dodgy' alley way -- you can safely ignore such descriptions as these minor lanes are quite common in cities in Vietnam and not at all 'dodgy'. This particular lane also has a great cocktail garden bar, right next door to the hotel (called The Secret Lounge). I only have one negative comment on the Hue Serene Palace Hotel, which is that the airy rooms with timber floors do come with the cost of a bit of noise. You can hear doors, footsteps and voices from the other rooms and the hallway. It's not a major problem and easily solved with a pair of earplugs for sleeping, but it could be a dealbreaker if you are sensitive to noise. All in all though I think the positives greatly outweigh this one negative.",50,28,NA,18,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lukesF795AA,Luke S,42826,Great modern hotel with wonderful staff,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293926-d4357913-Reviews-or650-Hue_Serene_Palace_Hotel-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html#REVIEWS

42795,"During our 3 weeks in Viet Nam, we stayed at several hotels and saw a wide variety of rooms because we were in a group. The Hue Serene Palace Hotel ranked as the best hotel we stayed at in Viet Nam by far. We wished that we could take it with us to all of our other Vietnamese destinations. For starters, they welcomed us with delicious juices. The elevator made getting up and down super easy, especially during check in/out with our luggage. The staff was amazing throughout our stay. They always made sure that we were comfortable and taken care of. The rooms are immaculate, and the beds were very comfortable.

The daily breakfast had a good variety as part of the buffet, and beyond that, as part of the included breakfast, you're able to order from the menu to get hot items too. We had dinner at the restaurant one night because we were too lazy to go out, and it was quite good, though a little pricier than the local restaurants.

Speaking of, the hotel was in a very good location close to some great restaurants, most notably Hanh Restaurant, which served a great prixe fixe menu that gives you a sampling of local Hue foods, and an unmarked oc (snail) restaurant on Ba Trieu. For the oc restaurant, just look for a commercial-looking restaurant (A Mo Quan on 04 Ba Trieu) with lots of big colorful food signs along the right-hand wall and DON'T go there; go to the divey one that is next to it to the left. Just ask the owner what you should eat.

The hotel also provides laundry service, and there was another (cheaper) laundry service just down the street too if you're willing to deal with the slight inconvenience of taking laundry out of the hotel.

Although it rained the entire time we were in Hue' and we couldn't make use of the balcony, it was still nice to have that extra space. Breakfast in the Serene Palace restaurant was fantastic, eggs and pho' cooked to order, and a nice continental buffet. The restaurant was also a perfect spot to have dinner, the food was fantastic. I can see why it is rated the no. 1 restaurant in Hue'. But the defining feature of this hotel is the staff. Ms Jenny, Ms Kelly and Ms Scarlett could not do enough for us. They were incredibly friendly, helpful and just so nice. They greeted us like old friends after a day of sightseeing, and always offered to assist in any way they could.

The Citadel is only about a 15 minute walk from the hotel along the river. Not a far walk at all. Right in front of the hotel is a rental place for scooters. I got one for a day to go visit the tombs. All I can say is if you go visit the tombs on your own as I did make sure you have GPS or you will not find them.

There were none of the issues of other reviews - the bedding was clean, the bathroom perfect and the room immaculate. The only slightly odd thing was being asked to sign a form - just standard boilerplate - before we checked in. I imagine it's all included in the booking terms and conditions, so I found it unnecessary.
The staff were super-helpful and gracious; though we had booked out after only one day, they looked after our bags while we spent the day sightseeing and even let us use a shower when we came back - and sit in the air-conditioned lobby until it was time to go.

42614,"After a reasonably uncomfortable overnight trip on the train from Hanoi we arrived, tired, sore and hot in Hue but a short car ride from the Station was a little piece of heaven called the Serene Palace Hotel..
If you are not a good train traveler my tip is to fly to Hue rather than take the train. Both John and I love train travel and although it was less comfortable than others we have taken we still enjoyed it.
Any how back to the Serene Palace Hotel which again was conveniently placed in the heart of the city and again was surrounded by interesting local lanes and streets filled with Restaurants, Bars and great shopping.
This hotel is another boutique hotel of around 30 rooms and is well equipped with a good dining room, Bar and well appointed rooms.
The Serene Palace appears to be a new property in very good condition and the rooms and bathrooms were comfortable, large and well decorated.
The winning formula of this Hotel and its greatest Asset is the staff. From the very beginning the ease of the check in, welcome dink, ice cold face-washers and friendliness of the staff was both surprising and appreciated.
Breakfast in the restaurant was fresh, ample, suitable for travelers from all over the world with not only the buffet but a wide choice of cooked products.
We also Dined in the Restaurant at night and was surprised by the quality, presentation of the food and how extensive the menu was. ( if you do dine here ask for the Royal Spring Rolls and wait to be amazed by the dish you get ) We discovered that this Restaurant is No.1 on Trip Advisor's list for the City of Hue and we think this is well deserved
Here again the ability of the staff to speak English blew us all away and so I asked one of the young girls how they learned this skill. Her reply was that she learned it as part of a Hospitality and hotel course at University so it shows how determined Vietnam is to improve its image as a destination for Tourism.

42614,"We booked this hotel before coming to Vietnam and we booked 5 nights, which we did not realise is far too long for Hue. My recommendation is that you only need 2 or 3 nights depending on arrival and departure times.
Our room is clean, tidy and well looked after. The thing that lets the room down is the bathroom. The bedroom is bright, spacious and modern and then you walk into a dingy little run-down bathroom. The ceiling tiles are stained and so is the bath. The shower is the worst we've had for hotels of a similar price - the shower head is too low down for taller people and it is quite weak. The little bottles of shower gel and shampoo are clearly refilled rather than replaced which seems a bit cheap since the labels on them have worn off making it difficult to work out which is which. The other negative about the room would be the tacky, plastic, sunflower bins. These don't really fit the style of the room and so they look out of place. Other than this the room is lovely but the bathroom lets it down.
Another thing would be the level of noise in this hotel. Every morning at 5am we were awoken to loud banging, slamming of doors, scraping of furniture, etc. We noticed that some rooms are being painted so we assume that it was staff but perhaps it was guests. The walls and floors are quite thin so you can hear your neighbours sometimes anyway. Either way we did not appreciate being woken this early every day.
Location is perfect. Right in the heart of the old town. Plenty of good restaurants nearby and within walking distance of the citadel. Plus taxis in this area are cheap if you don't want to walk to dinner.
The hotel restaurant is rated as the best in Hue and we can see why. Service is fantastic and the food is lovely too. There is a huge selection to choose from and we tried many dishes during our stay, all of which were delicious. If you stay here you have to try the restaurant! The breakfast was also good with the same service.
The general service of the hotel staff was good. Everyone was friendly and they helped us arrange some private cars and did some laundry for us which is a good price. The one negative would be that the first information we received on Hue and the attractions was rather limited unbeknownst to us. When we went to ask for some specific information the 2nd day, after we had visited the citadel. The lady informed us about the combination ticket for this and the royal tombs which would have saved us a significant amount of money. This was a little disappointing and we just paid individually in the end.
I can understand why this hotel is rated so well. It is fantastic value for money but we have stayed in some other hotels in Vietnam which have the same nightly rate and they are slightly better. The room, restaurant, location, and service here are all generally good. It was just the few things mentioned above which let it down for us.",30,16,NA,51,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharlotteDoddy,CharlotteDoddy,42614,Good and bad,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293926-d4357913-Reviews-or870-Hue_Serene_Palace_Hotel-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html#REVIEWS

42583,"The hotel was able to arrange a late pick up from the airport with one of their drivers. Ride was about 20 mins or so. Most hotels and hostels in Hue are located in alleys, the Serene Palace Hotel no different. There are signs at the ends of the alley to help navigate, though I did miss the sign a few times. On our second day, one of the front desk staff approached us at breakfast and asked us when we arrived and said she was worried that we'd get lost because we never got a map of the area. Seems like they take their customer service seriously and I appreciate that she approached us to make sure that we got the same treatment as guests she had previously greeted. The beds are extremely comfortable! And the room is very clean. There is seasonal fruit left in your room each day. We got green bananas and passion fruit, both were perfectly ripe and sweet!! There is even an umbrella in the room for your use. 5 stars for the room and staff!

The buffet was ok. The fresh fruit and juices and bread are self serve and you order your main items off the menu with the waitress. I like this idea because it leaves much less food waste at the end of a buffet. On the menu there are some Vietnamese soups, eggs+bacon/sausage, pancakes among other options.

It's a spacious, luxurious and clean hotel with super friendly staff (they brought us some free bites, drinks and cold towels when we arrived) that helped us a lot with getting around in Hue. Most of them speak excellent English, so that helps.

The rooms have the same characteristics as the hotel: spacious, luxurious and clean. We almost felt bad being in the city that much and not in the room.

For the price you pay, this hotel cannot be beaten. You get a lot of value for your money. Plus, the hotel has a great restaurant to boot (#1 on TripAdvisor).

The breakfast of all you can eat off the menu was ok... The local food tastier than the western menu.

42552,"We got a free tomato salad starter here which was very nice.

We ordered the bacon burger and the spaghetti bolognese. Both were excellent.

We both had the chocolate mousse which was also very good. Cold, ice-cream-like. Very different to what we are used to but very well-prepared!

For drinks we had a big bottle of water to share.

The total bill was 294.000 dong, so we rounded it up to 300.000. This small tip was definitely worth it because they offered us a 10 percent discount coupon for our next visit. PLUS 2 coupons for a free cocktail when bought one for another place (which they probably own).

I know it's all business but better this than nothing. Staff was friendly, food was very good and not at all expensive for a restaurant like this.

I know a comparison is not so representative but just for fun:

Salad: 6 €
Bacon burger: 8 €
Spaghetti: 12 €
Big water: 4 €
Chocolate x2: 12 €

42552,"We stayed in this hotel's sister establishments in both Hanoi and Hoi An (also rated at 3 stars) and this was definitely the worst of the three. That's not to say it was bad, just a bit of a let down after the other two. We stayed our first night in a family room, at the front of the hotel on the 2nd floor, but there was too much noise from both the karaoke bar next door and from the street. The hotel kindly moved us into two separate rooms on the 6th floor for no extra charge, so top marks for this. The rooms were fine, although the air conditioning in one really struggled to keep the room cool (it was noticeably hotter than the other room, despite being the same size).

Breakfast was ok (but again not as good as the other hotels in this chain) and we didn't mind the location in the narrow laneway - we never felt unsafe and it was pretty well located in the main part of town. We had a bit of a bad end to our stay when the hotel advised us that we'd only need to leave 1.5 hours before our flight and then booked the car for 7pm instead of 7am - we just made our flight.

42522,"This is a very good quality budget hotel with excellent service and a great restaurant. It's a 10 minute walk from the riverside and 10 minutes by taxi to the citadel.

We stayed in a ""serene"" room which was extremely spacious and nicely decorated and which had a balcony on the 7th floor with great views over the town. The bathroom was a bit utilitarian compared to the room decor but not a big deal considering the price. The room was actually a lot nicer than I expected for the price so no problem. It was also well kitted out - king size bed, chairs and table in room and chairs on balcony, safe, computer, mini bar, TV etc. There was nothing lacking.

The staff couldn't do enough for us and were extremely helpful. They went out of their way to help with some belongings we forgot at the hotel, putting it on a bus to Hoi An where we were staying for us to collect - all free of charge. Great service!

The hotel restaurant is ranked No 1 on Tripadvisor. We ate there a couple of times and the food was pretty good. You can also get room service. Breakfast was fruit and bread self-service and a large selection of cooked items to order from the menu.

Another plus is laundry at $2 per kilo which is a bit more than outside (which is understandable) but significantly less than the per item charges at most hotels.

My husband had a massage at their sister hotel and said it was the best and the cheapest he had in Vietnam!

We had a balcony and they kindly brought up two chairs when we requested seating. The hotel is in a narrow back lane and this made it interesting seeing more of the life of the locals.

Staff told us about a fantastic local restaurant serving the Hue specialty of barbecue pork and broken rice. we went there several times. Also had the green beans with garlic - delicious and cheap food. It's called Thanh Na Restaurant - in the next street parallel to the hotel.
The hotel's included breakfast was fine too and their wifi is secure and reliable. At short notice they organised for a very good and careful driver to take us to the Thien Mu Pagoda and the Khai Dinh and Minh Mang tombs for an afternoon - it was fascinating to see the different styles of each tomb and then wonderful to get back into the airconditioned car between sorties. We had taken a taxi from the hotel to see the Citadel in the morning. You can do it easily by yourself and don't need a guide as there's plenty of information once you get in there and it's really worthwhile to visit.

42491,"Shortly after booking the stay we received an email from the hotel offering to arrange a taxi ride from the train station for $4. This may have been slightly higher than the market rate, but it was worth not having to try to figure out transportation on arrival.

We arrived early, so the room was not ready yet, but during our 30 minute wait the staff brought us a delicious fruit plate and gave us a quick run-down on what to do around the city. We decided to hire a car for the afternoon to go to the citadel, the tombs, and the pagoda ($40).

The staff then showed us to our room which they had upgraded from Superior to City View at no extra charge. The room was very nice with faux-wood floors, clean bedding, and complimentary fruit and water. The air conditioner worked great, and the hot water was searing hot--so be careful about just jumping into the shower! The room had a view over the entire city.

After the tour, we decided to eat dinner at the hotel's restaurant. Again, the staff was extremely professional and helpful the entire time, and dinner was somewhat expensive ($20 for 2 people) but delicious. The included breakfast the next morning was also delicious with exotic fresh fruit and both western and local hot dishes.

As far as negatives go, there were only a few: this hotel is somewhat hidden away in a back alley and is not in the middle of everything. The prices are slightly higher than most of the rest of the area (but they make up for the higher prices with outstanding service). This is another hotel that requires you to turn off electricity to your room while you're away and let your room get hot and humid (though this is standard practice in Vietnamese hotels, changing that one feature would make any room worth at least a few dollars a night more).

When we checked out the bill was presented to us in USD which was a bit odd and we would have preferred to have it in the local currency. The staff tried to talk us out of getting a Taxi to one of the tombs saying that it might be difficult getting one back to town. It turned out it was no problem. We just agreed on a time to be picked up and another Taxi was there waiting for us. The previous day the Taxi just waited for us while we visites the tomb.

42461,"Stayed for 5 nights in April 2016 as a couple

Pros:
- Outstanding Customer Service
- Great Value for Money
- Large, Clean, Comfortable Rooms
- Excellent WiFi

Cons:
- Location can be off-putting at first
- Single elevator can mean long waits (it's only 7 floors or so, stairs aren't a big issue)

It's very hard to find something wrong with the Serene Palace. From the moment we booked the staff was working hard to make our stay as enjoyable as possible. When we first booked, a hotel staff member emailed us within a few minutes to see if there was anything they could do to make our stay more enjoyable, and to arrange transportation.
We arranged an airport pickup, and the driver was there with a sign and a clean modern car.

The saying ""don't judge a book by it's cover"" is perhaps never more applicable than when arriving at the Hue Serene Palace. We were a bit skeptical as the driver pulled into a small narrow alleyway. But fear not, to our surprise the entrance was clean and modern and we were greeted by 2 bellboys. The hotel staff then asked us to sit down and arranged our check-in while more staff brought us cold juice and fruit. Check-in was quick and efficient and we were soon brought to our room.

Rooms: The rooms are huge, even by western standards. The rooms have a large comfortable bed, seating area, ours even had a small balcony perfect to enjoy a coffee on after a long day of exploring. The AC worked well and quickly cooled down the rooms. Shower had high pressure and hot water. The wifi worked very well. The TV worked great and had a selection of western channels. The one oddity was that the rooms utilize an actual key (something I haven't seen in awhile in a hotel), instead of keycards. It isn't a problem at all, just an observation. The rooms were quiet and we never heard other guests. Rooms were cleaned daily by an incredibly kind and responsive housekeeping staff. The rooms also had a computer, which was handy to write emails back home and for checking out tours and attractions. The rooms are nearly apartment sized, and come with nearly everything you could need.

Breakfast: While I have separately reviewed the restaurant (we ate there many times) the included breakfast is really good. Service is impeccable and the staff is incredible responsive. They have typical western as well as Vietnamese options. There are also smoothie and other beverage options. It isn't a buffet style but instead a menu, and the staff want to make sure you're full and satisfied. There were numerous bread and fruit options.

Location and Property: As other reviewers have mentioned the hotel is located in an alley, which is off-putting at first. However, once you explore a little you realize the alley is only about 100 meters long, and is quite busy. The alley is also fairly well lit, and we never felt unsafe. The property itself is well-maintained and clean. The only issue I had was with the elevator, there is only 1 and at peak times (in the AM) it can be busy. That being said the hotel is only 7 floors, so it isn't the biggest pain to climb the stairs, but if you've got mobility issues it could be a problem.

The hotel is centrally located. The backpackers/bar district is about 5 minutes away on foot. The Citadel is about a 10 minute drive (35 minute walk). There is a night market about 15 minutes away on foot that sells souvenirs and has a few restaurants. Location is very central for exploring everything Hue has to offer.

Staff: The staff here are the real standout. Everyone was genuinely concerned that we enjoyed every aspect of our stay. The staff was among the kindest people we met in Vietnam. Jenny and Sally were both amazing and went above and beyond to ensure we enjoyed our time. Staff all spoke great English, and seemed genuinely interested in our enjoyment and also what we thought of Vietnam and Hue. They took pride in their hotel and their jobs, and this translated into a fantastic experience. The staff here provided better service than any I've ever had.

Conclusion: Don't let the alley way affect your decision, this is a fantastic choice and truly deserving of a 5 star rating. Amazing value for money.

Room and Hotel Tips:
- If you're planning on doing laundry while visiting Vietnam I'd suggest getting it done here. The cost was very reasonable (2USD per kilo) and they did a great job, they did not damage, lose, or shrink any of my clothes.
- We organized multiple excursions through the hotel and were satisfied with each one. We did the following:
- Private car to the beach (Beach Bar) (US $28)
- Private car to Minh Manh and Khai Dinh tomb, and the pagoda (US $32)
- Private car to Hoi An (US $60)
- While other agencies will offer tours for a lower price, we weren't sure if they would be trustworthy or if the cars would be modern or shared. We stuck with the hotel and we always had modern safe cars and the drivers were quite punctual. I'd highly recommend booking transport with the hotel.

42461,"During a two-week backpacking journey from northern Vietnam to central, Hue Serene Palace was probably the best value and our favorite hotel.

Honestly, as our cab pulled into the tiny alley that the hotel is located on, we were a bit skeptical. Even upon entering the lobby, which was empty at the time of our arrival, we were a bit hesitant. But from the moment we sat down, we were sold.

We were greeted with juice and fruit and told our room would be ready shortly. During that time one of the receptionists (whose English was great), provided us with a map of Hue and showed us what we could do in a day.

We stayed one night in a twin room. The room was clean, spacious, and comfortable. The beds were comfortable and clean, the bathroom was clean and spacious, and there was a desktop computer hooked up to the internet for use. We noticed that the tv in our room was also equipped with Chromecast, which was pretty awesome. We were able to hook up our music to the tv and relax.

The hotel is only a 10-minute cab ride from the Hue train station, a 30-minute walk from the Imperial City, maybe 10-15 minutes from the night market/river, and very near the bar street.

The restaurant downstairs at the hotel is also excellent and very well-priced. Breakfast was included in our room fee. The breakfast menu includes both local and Western options. I had the crepes, which weren't bad and my friend had the chicken pho, which was pretty good. There is also a fruit buffet. We opted to also eat at the restaurant for dinner and were very pleasantly surprised. Hotel patrons get a 10% discount at the restaurant.

42461,"When sitting in a transfer and you drive up a narrow alley that looks like it's leading to a dodgy zone- don't be afraid! You're led to a lovely hotel with bell boys and staff at your every disposal.
They were kind, courteous. Fruit and juice upon arrival, and quick to prepare our room when they'd learnt we had been on an overnight train. Sat down to explain your options and guides. Took all luggage to our room.
Restaurant on site is helpful- especially when a thunder storm blows through town. Food is hearty and tasty.
Our private tour organised by the hotel (40usd pp) was good- although suffice to say if you're a larger person you will potentially be insulted.
I spent a good 30 mins over the 6hr tour being insulted by the guide. Telling me that it's not healthy to be fat, I should be vegetarian, I cannot be married as no man wants me if I'm fat.
Now little does she know, (even though I tried to explain ) that 80% of diet is vegetarian and I exercise all the time. Later in the tour when she looks tired and bored- she asked if I was tired, that I may drop dead! After explaining that I work a very physical 12-14hr day in London every day- she shut up and kept her thoughts to herself.
The information and lunch was very helpful, and I did enjoy it. Just not the additional comments.

A bit of noise from guests locking and unlocking their rooms, hubby commented it sounded like locking cell doors in a prison, but that was a slight over exaggeration.
We booked a trip through the hotel, boat out to the pagoda and private car out to 2 tombs which cost us USD45, probably could have got cheaper elsewhere but with only 2 days in the city it was easy to arrange. The car was a new 4x4 which was very comfortable on a very hot day.

42401,"Serene Palace lives up to its reputation as an excellent hotel. While I will give details of little things that may or may not affect your decision to stay there, the overall experience can not be faulted. This is due mainly to the staff, who provide excellent service with a smile from the moment you enter the door to the moment you leave. Welcome drink and fruit greet you, and fruit is also provided in your room each day along with a bottle of water and coffee and tea for each guest. Of course, breakfast pretty much has all you can eat fruit as well. Also included in breakfast is a menu that you can order from to your heart's delight.

We paid more for a balcony room, but there was no balcony furniture, so we couldn't actually sit out there, which is something we love to do and a reason we pay for such rooms. Perhaps they have furniture out there in other seasons, but honestly, there was very little room to accommodate furniture. It's more of a standing balcony, which for us, defeats the purpose.

Our room included a safe, a jetted tub (not so easy to shower in as the hand held shower head doesn't have a long extension, but lovely to soak in), a kettle, a comfortable sitting area near the window, and best of all a desktop computer (it would occasionally crash, but we found it more useful than we would have imagined and definitely missed it when we moved on to other cities).

As we stayed 4 nights, the hotel offered free pick-up at the train station. Our train was 2 hours late, but they were there waiting with a smile and a clearly marked sign with our name.

We would definitely recommend staying here and would come back to Hue simply to do so again.

Jenny was always replying to my questions through the emails immediately and giving us some good advice as well. (eg: I asked her to organize a big car from the airport for 4 adults & 2 kids. Firstly she offered a 7 seaters car, but she thought we might struggle with lots of luggage so she gently asked if we needed 16 seaters car which she was right! we could not have fit into the 7 seater ! )
We also want to say thank you to the driver for both legs, he drove really carefully. ( and did not take any calls while he was driving.) We were very happy to see he was our driver again for the second leg to Hoi An.Please let him know how much we appreciated it. (always nervous with the kids.)

Our kids wanted to go back to this hotel when we were in Hoi An, as the staff were really kind with them.

We also liked the breakfasts a lot! The fruits (especially mango) were really tasty.
I had beef pho every day for breakfast. I already miss it!!
The hotel itself is relatively simple compared with big international hotels, but is has everything you need for a short trip to Hue and is kept really clean and is clearly very well run.

42401,"The best thing about this hotel is easily the restaurant, although it's great on almost everything else too. The restaurant in the hotel is (at the time of writing) TripAdvisor's number 1 restaurant in Hue, and is very tasty, especially since it's also really cheap. The breakfast they served was also quite good. The staff were very friendly and chatty and remember you and your food preferences when you return. When I asked if they could make a packed sandwich for my lunch, they did it with a smile and at no charge. The restaurant was packed every evening.
The check-in was smooth and we were given tonnes of info on Hue and possible tours. The staff were all nice and friendly. The rooms were clean, spacious and comfortable, and even contained a computer in case you fancy doing a bit of light work. Our standard room contained a bath, and the shower worked well. The soap and toiletries were pretty cheap and could do with an upgrade, along with the in-room safe which was old and fidgety and always took many frustrated attempts to get open.
The location is central but it's located down a dark and dodgy looking alley. If you approach from the north it's not too far into the alley and it's lit, but if you're coming from the south then you either have to walk down a long, dark & narrow alley, or go the long way around.",40,83,"Dublin, Ireland",56,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theallseeingguy,theallseeingguy,42401,Great hotel with a great restauramt,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293926-d4357913-Reviews-or1080-Hue_Serene_Palace_Hotel-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html#REVIEWS
42401,"Pity about the location - down that long narrow lane. We didn't know what sort of a dive the taxi driver was bringing us to.
However, as soon as we stepped out of the taxi, all our concerns were assuaged by the welcome, and the friendliness of the reception girls who made us feel right at home.
Even though we arrived before 11:00 am, they got our rooms ready, and our bags up while we had welcome drinks and fruit bowl.

The room itself was lovely, and the bed very comfortable. Good wifi.

Another advantage is that you don't have to go far for one of the best restaurants in Hue - it's inhouse. If you forget to book a table, they'll call you as soon as one is free, and the tables are turned over quickly.

Best of all, the price is so reasonable. However, we got better prices from Cafe on Thu Wheels for tours and transfers.

The rooms are reasonably spacious although a little short of storage space, the bed is comfortable (although the sheet arrangement is a little quirky) and the aircon works well. There’s also a computer terminal (as well as free wifi) in each room. Go for a room on the top floor with a balcony for nice views of the town. Breakfast is OK, and the other meals are actually pretty good, although the setting (basically an extension of the hotel lobby) lacks a bit of ambience.

Where the Serene excels however is it’s staff. Jenny was very helpful in answering our questions before we arrived and the wonderful Sally and the restaurant staff couldn’t do enough for us.

One word about the location: it’s down a quiet lane, which means it is out of the bothersome traffic (don’t be worried by the nearby karaoke bars, we hardly heard a peep from them). However, the lane itself is potholed and gets very muddy and slippery when it rains. My partner went over and cut her leg and hand quite badly just outside the hotel. Sally and other staff went immediately into action with the first aid kit, and there was no permanent damage done. However, the lane way sometimes needs hiking boots! Work was underway while we were there to smooth out the surface with sand but a more permanent surface would be a great improvement.

The hotel is indeed located down an alley with other hotels and coffee shops, but we found the hotel to be quiet and peaceful. It is walking distance to shops and restaurants ,and we walked several times to the river and the market. For those not inclined to walk the distance, the hotel staff promptly can arrange taxi service. One of the best features of the hotel is it's restaurant which serves a wonderful variety of dishes a a very affordable price.

Breakfast was nice too; buffet of fruit and bread plus we could order off the menu. We were unwell for a couple of days while staying here and ordered room service a few times. Not incredible food but always prompt and hot.

The location down the alley is a little odd perhaps but it gave it character and meant the hotel was pretty quiet. Close enough to walk to the Citadel - about twenty minutes.

42370,"This is one of those instances where what I found in TA did not meet my expectations. I stayed in hotels in Hanoi, Hoi An, Saigon and this was my least favorite. The pictures you see are better than what you get in person. One thing I realized about Hue is that there is no such thing as a central location. The sites are just all over the place that you just have to find a hotel that you like and go for it. Maybe the standards in Hue are different than in other places in Vietnam but if this hotel gets 5 stars from TA then I dont know what a true 5 star really means.

Let me start with the good, the email communication with this hotel is excellent. Jenny responded to every single question I sent via email, quick and reliable. I needed a very quiet room and they delivered on the top floor. On our first night our neighbor had their TV blasting, you can hear it through the concrete walls. Maybe they should rethink on how the TV is mounted on the wall. There is also a Karaoke bar close to the hotel and I can hear it from my top floor room. I had to wear my earplugs when I sleep. Keep in mind that I am very sensitive to sound so this might not be an issue for a normal person. Jenny also gave us a good rate for a pickup from Hoi An to the hotel (55 USD). Very good car service. The location is a bit not to my preference. Its on a narrow alley with a lot of local establishments which is fine if this is your taste. Is it central? it depends on what you are looking for. If you want the tourist sites then not really as I mentioned above, they are all over the place. We walked from the hotel to the Citadel and it was a 20 min walk and we are fast walkers. You can walk to a lot of restaurants and shops from the hotel. Which is why I put the location still on the positive side. The internet is really fast and they even give you a desktop in the room, this was very helpful.

Now for the not so good. Throughout my travels in Vietnam I have encountered a different level of excellent service in different hotels which made it very memorable. However, I did not get that impression from this place during our stay. I can't put my finger in it but the service was just lacking and inconsistent. I think I got the best service from the bell boys who help us with the luggage and open the doors for us all the time. Those front desk girls, not so much. I had a few instances when I felt some attitude. Maybe its a language barrier but I didnt feel that in other hotels in Vietnam. We dropped off our laundry in the morning and I asked the front desk what time will it be available and they said in the evening. When I picked it up in the evening, it wasn't there. Instead of being apologetic, the girl kept questioning me if I dropped it off because she couldnt find it. At last when Jenny looked into it, she found it. When we checked the items, we were missing a sock. We went down and they found it somewhere. You also dont get the best information when you ask for restaurants or whats what. Things like this bothered me about the service. Service for me is only 3 stars.

There were a few noise issues during my stay, the loud TV in the adjacent room, the karaoke bar and the dragging furniture from people who are cleaning early Sunday morning. Mind you, we were on the top floor so these noises came from adjacent rooms. For a small place like this with just a few rooms I dont think they should start dragging furniture till after 9. .

Aesthetically, beauty of the property is only skin deep. It is clean but as one looks closely, there are some things that are worth mentioning. The bathroom grout and caulking is falling apart. I dont know if it is mold or mildew but there are black stuff in the caulking. Hand held showers dont work for me. The interior is just cheap and tacky for my taste. You have to lock the door when you leave and it is not just a matter of click and close. Its more of a pull and turn and turn and turn. They need to upgrade their lock system.

Before you get too excited about more than a thousand reviews resulting to a 5 star rating for this hotel, pick and choose which reviews you can trust. Thats not just for this hotel but for any review out there. It is all about credibility. I am not saying this hotel is bad but im definitely not a fan. I just feel that there are other hotels in the same price point that could give me more satisfaction. In retrospect, I would have rather paid more money and stayed at the M Gallery or the Indochine Palace. If are a bit tight on budget and you are not concerned about the points I mentioned above then this place might work for you.",30,301,"Chicago, Illinois",805,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexisRF,AlexisRF,42339,Lukewarm,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293926-d4357913-Reviews-or1130-Hue_Serene_Palace_Hotel-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html#REVIEWS

Too tired to venture outside for dinner we thought we would try the hotel’s restaurant for dinner. Trip Advisor had rated it number one in Hue and we were not disappointed. The food was fantastic! We tried the pomelo salad, morning glory salad, crispy seafood pancakes and chicken curry and loved every bite. The girls in the restaurant are very efficient and so friendly, all of them spend time at each table getting to know the clients. The lady in charge Miss Sally is delightful and ensures everything goes smoothly.
The breakfast buffet was also very good with the usual fresh fruits and breads and a good choice of hot cooked to order items.
After a full day visiting the tombs and citadel we returned to the hotel and once again had dinner there, we had enjoyed our previous dinner so much that we ordered the same food again and shared it between us! Whoever is in the kitchen is doing a fantastic job!

42339,"The Serene Palace was one of the best hotels we stayed at in our 4 week tour and at a bit less than 27USD/night for the Superior Double it was exceptional value. Every aspect of our stay was impressive. Our room was large, very clean, nicely decorated and had a window that opened. The bed was large and very comfortable with good pillows. It had arm chairs and a coffee table as well as a desk and chair. It also had a computer in the room. WiFi connection was faultless. Air conditioning was adjustable and much appreciated after a few hours exploring. The en-suite was a good size with reliable hot water and pressure. The hotel had a good sized lift. The laundry service was good value. The staff were friendly and helpful. I especially appreciated the 'bell boys' who were engaging and quick with a smile, to open doors and to help with luggage. Breakfast was excellent with lots of variety. In a country where exceptional hotel service seems to be the norm, the dining staff at the Serene Palace really are exceptional. Sally who seemed to be the restaurant manager made a point of greeting all clients and making sure their needs were taken care of. When she knew I wasn't well, she made ginger tea for me and had a colleague go buy me yoghurt because my husband had suggested I might be able to eat it. The Serene Palace has the number 1 ranking for dining in Hue and we had some memorable evening meals at very good prices. If staying at the hotel, they give a 10% discount on food. Its location on a small road/lane meant the hotel was quiet but it is an easy walk to the river and Palace and we felt safe walking in the area at night.The fare from the railway station in a green Mai Linh taxi (one of the taxi companies reputed to be reliable) was 50 000VND (about 3.30 AUD). We did walk to the station and back one day but it is a fair distance with luggage.

When we were leaving I realised that I had left my watch in the safe (it was unlocked but we hadn't noticed it when taking our other things out).

Their restaurant is also very popular in general and you can eat a meal there if need be. Food was very good and their chocolate mousse dessert is absolutely delicious!

42309,"Stayed here with my fiance Nov 2015. First off, you're better off emailing the hotel ahead and asking to get a transfer from the airport. Our taxi driver wasn't sure where it was even after we gave him the address, or he just didn't want to drive down the narrow, almost hidden little alley, so we walked down until we found it. Luckily, it wasn't very far, took us about 2 minutes. Look out for signs for the ""Serene Palace Restaurant.""

The hotel staff were very attentive and spoke great English. They organised all our tours for us very easily. The room was very spacious and clean with the usual complimentary water, tea, coffee and also fruit which was a nice surprise.

One very minor thing though, the door is a bit stiff and the lock is a bit finnicky. Also, the bed was HUGE! But very comfortable. However, the sheets were actually two blankets layered in such a way to cover the whole bed. This actually worked out better when we took them off and just had one blanket each. These are all very minor things, did not detract from the experience at all.

Breakfast was also extremely good. The set up is not so much a buffet as it is a cafe. They seat you with a menu which has European and Viet options. Try the fried dumplings! Special mention to Sally there who always took care of us, and even packed us a bunch of bananas to take with us when we checked out!

Finally, definitely try the restaurant for lunch and/or dinner! The food was sublime, especially the garlic prawns. And you can get anything you like from the restaurant via room service.

The room was very spacious. Clean. And nicely decorated. I am a bit of nit pick when it comes to bathrooms and the cleanliness of the bathroom fixtures. This hotel did not disappoint. The WiFi in the hotel worked better than in our hotel in Saigon.

The hotel is located in an alley that is nice and quiet. The location requires you to walk a little bit (500m) to get to the busy street on the south side called Nguyen Thai Hoc to get to the plentiful restaurants and side-walk food stands.I purposely look for hotels in quiet alleys for a bit of peace.

Most appreciated was the staff and the service that we received at this hotel - Serene Palace hotel. My parents and I were very happy with the young adults (recent university grads) who were happy to attend to our needs while also taking the opportunity to practise their English. The English communication skills of the staff was very good. (Disclaimer: I can speak Vietnamese. But like a child who grew up in the South of Vietnam. But, I have a difficult time understanding the strong Vietnamese accent of the Hue region. I prefer to speak in English whenever possible in Vietnam because thinking in English is easier for me.

The breakfast is another highlight as it's basically all you can eat so definitely worth paying for this. The only thing to be aware of us that it's on a lane, about 3 mins walk off the main road.

42278,"This is another hotel where it's Tripadvisor standing is a puzzle to me. It was clean and staff were efficient but otherwise it was merely functional, lacking in any sort of charm, character or flair; Internally it was bland with cheap finishes.
The bed had a strange two duvet set up which was far too hot. However, when I took the top duvet off, the bottom one was so short that my feet stuck out the end and I am only 5'3""! The pillows were solid.
The bathroom had the most ridiculous bath I've ever seen in a hotel, so short it was impossible to do other than half lie and so narrow that elbows banged against the sides. Because it is a whirlpool bath, there is a nozzle in the end just where the small of the back should go - So uncomfortable!
The room is very noisy and it is possible to hear what is happening from quite a way away.
On the plus side the staff tried hard. A very good driver was arranged to collect us from the airport and he also took us on a tour round the tombs and citadel.
Breakfasts were fairly dull but the lunch we ate in the restaurant was excellent. We did not eat dinner here because the restaurant lacked atmosphere - it was just more fun to go into town to eat.

42278,"The staff at this hotel we were very welcoming and obliging. Restaurant staff were good too. The location was very good. However, we came away with the feeling that whoever designed this hotel and its rooms had never actually stayed in a hotel themselves. The room itself was spacious and reasonably quiet but that's about the best thing I can say about it. The curtains were about 25 cms too short so that light entered under them early morning. Other than a rail in the robe on which to hang clothes, and the total of four tiny drawers in the desk and bedside tables (in which you might just fit a Gideon's bible), there was absolutely nowhere in the room in which to store anything else (underwear etc), which meant we had to leave EVERYTHING in our cases and rummage through them any time we wanted something. Doing this for the four days we were in Hue was very frustrating. The power outlets were in the weirdest places. We could not find anywhere to plug in the electric jug that didn't leave the jug (which had a ridiculously short cord) at a dangerous and preposterous angle. In the end, we placed it on the bench in the bathroom, on top of a book, so that the cord could reach the power outlet there. Admittedly, this hotel was very reasonably priced, but had we known what to expect beforehand we would have gladly paid a few more dollars or dong to get decent basic facilities. Maybe the hotel owners can provide each room with longer curtains, jugs with longer cords, and a chest of drawers, and charge a couple of dollars more. It would certainly make a stay in this hotel so much more pleasant.",30,22,Canberra,35,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BettyBoop51,BettyBoop51,42248,"Good staff, room leaves a lot to be desired",Trip type: Traveled as a couple,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293926-d4357913-Reviews-or1210-Hue_Serene_Palace_Hotel-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html#REVIEWS

The rooms are spacious with a wonderfully comfortable bed (a delight after the soft sleeper on the train). There is also a pc for you to use in the room if needed. There are tea and coffee making facilities in the room and fresh fruit and bottled water supplied daily.

Bathroom is big with a fantastic high pressure shower. Toiletries are supplied. My only complaint with the bathroom (at a push) would be that you couldn't adjust the shower head and so the water tended to leak over the side but this was countered with a recessed drain beside the bath.

Wifi was patchy on my phone but the tablet picked it up ok. Sound transmits, we could hear rooms being cleaned upstairs and footsteps on the stairs quite easily. That said we slept fairly soundly.

Breakfast steals the show. You can order as much from the menu as you like. Tea/coffee/fruit juice. The pancakes and dumplings are delicious.

Staff were friendly and helpful at all times. They are able to arrange bus/train/taxi as needed.

The service at reception, from the bellboys, the cleaning staff and the restaurant staff was faultless, and always performed with a charming smile.

- amazing value for the quality of hotel

Cons:
- if I had to think of a con, the location although perfect for sightseeing was located in a small alley. The hotel was a bit of a challenge to find on arrival.

42248,"Overall, Hue Serene Palace is a fantastic place to stay particularly given the price tag. However, we experienced a couple things that cause pause and should be voiced.

The Good: The cleanliness of this hotel for the price and location is absolutely astounding. The decor inside the room is new. The beds are incredibly comfortable. I can't believe we paid $17 USD for the room. Yes, they each have a desktop computer included in the room. Flatscreen TV, plenty of channels in English as well as strong wifi. Daily fruit and water are provided in the room.

Breakfast deserves some special accolades. It's beyond generous! ALYC and we ate our room rate's worth daily.

Could be improved: Aside from the many TA mentions of the hotel's location, I concur that the dirt, potholed road leading to the alley of karaoke bars is not ideal.

The other three areas that need attention include: the restaurant staff implying improper ""services"" provided to guests; the ease in extending stays and noise.

1) This is hard to report, as the restaurant staff is so kind. However, it deserves a mention. Restaurant staff commented at EVERY meal about my male travel partner - his looks, his relationship status, etc. One night, he ordered take away and they stated he could have room service instead. He was then asked which waitress he would like to bring up his meal. He asked for clarification and was then told that all the staff like him, so he could choose who brought his food to his room. It takes a lot to make a 6'4"" white American man uncomfortable, but this offer absolutely did.

Hue has a huge issue with both prostitution and drugs. After several days of interactions with the staff, I could tell they are really nice women and tend to joke around a bit with guests. I don't think it was meant as a prostitution offer. However, to imply that he could have his pick of waitresses to bring food up to his bedroom could really put staff at risk had he expected anything other than the simple delivery of food. It should be addressed so the staff are kept safe (and wives and girlfriends don't get upset).

2) Upon expressing an interest in extending our hotel stay, it was a bit of a hassle to negotiate the same booked rate we found online. I prefer to have the hotel receive my money directly upon extension, rather than a 3rd party taking their cut, especially if I at all like the hotel. In my attempt to extend my $17 rate ($20.18 with tax), I was offered $32/night. When stating what I paid, I was told that was impossible, they didn't offer such a low rate. After pulling it up on the 3rd party site, staff then said it was a $17 rate with $8 in taxes. Again, I had to show them what I paid, tax inclusive. We went back and forth and I was finally offered the same rate. It should have been a bit more clearcut to provide them with my money.

3) the design of the hotel encourages noise to travel from floor to floor of this hotel. Guests slamming doors, yelling, running up and down the stairs at all hours is really disruptive requiring rear plugs. They've installed a door from the ground floor to floor two, muffling the breakfast noise so many other TripAdvisor reviews mention. These soundproof doors should be installed at least floor to floor. It would be even better to have these doors (the same as the bathroom doors) installed as the doors to each room. They would eliminate the noise issue.

Tip: Metered taxis from the train station are only 40K. Don't let them talk you into anything more than 50K.",30,105,"Nashville, Tennessee",298,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vagabond_Yogini,Megan S,42248,High Highs and Low Lows,Trip type: Traveled with friends,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293926-d4357913-Reviews-or1240-Hue_Serene_Palace_Hotel-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html#REVIEWS

Then they carried our luggage to our room, got our room ready and then showed us the way to our room. All the staff here were super friendly, from receptionist to restaurant staff. They were all very personal in their service. The room itself is the best we have stayed in during our whole trip in Central Vietnam. Too bad it was only for a night. The restaurant is ranked no.1 on TripAdvisor. You could order anything off the menu for breakfast and mind you, the food is super tasty. We had our dinner in the restaurant as well, with a discount as in-house guests. I have never had a better stay than here. They even went all the way to send me an email after my stay to thank us for staying. My parents and I all agreed totally that this is the best hotel we have ever stayed in!

42217,"We only stayed for one evening, but we really enjoyed our stay. We ate at the restaurant in the hotel and would highly recommend it- the food was amazing!

The only thing I would avoid against doing is booking your transport/car service in Hue through the hotel as we paid $35 to go to three different places (excluding entrance fees) and we could have paid a LOT less if we just booked separate taxis. It was convenient, but not the cheapest option.

Overall we would recommend this hotel though. The staff we excellent- very polite and had lots of information to share.

The friendly welcome, fruit juice and plate of fruit was much appreciated in the heat. Our room did not disappoint, clean, tidy. Had a safe and fridge, bath robes, TV. Everything you could need. Shower excellent.

Breakfast was a feast with a choice of western or vietnamese cuisine, or both! Plus a self service fruit buffet. The breakfast was in the restaurant which was itself a very decent eating spot and we chose to eat back at the hotel for a couple of nights because it was that good.

42217,"As soon as you enter the place, you are greeted by friendly and helpful staff with a complimentary drink and fruit. They quickly checked me in and took me into my room immediately (via elevator), especially great after an overnight train from Hanoi. I was even a few hours early for check-in but they still accommodated me. Brilliant!

Beautiful and clean room, which had complimentary fruit and water daily. This was about $25USD, bathroom and room itself is very spacious and modern. Safe is there for you to store valuables, Desktop computer there, tv and wifi too should you need it, closet with hangers along with some beautiful ornaments for the room. Almost felt museum-like.

Tip for room: One with windows. I was in a room with windows, but was covered up because it'd mean staring out into the corridoor. The room I had was in between rooms with window views, but they later upgraded me to a room with a balcony and massage bath. I think because of my earlier than expected check-in, I got the first room. Not that I mind, I was there for a really short 2 night stay. I was just grateful!

Staff are so friendly and very accommodating. Sourced me a driver to do my own personal itinerary when I called from room. Sorted in 10 mins. Staff provided great advice for tours, temples and local spots - found a really good restaurant - can't recall now, but oh so delicious! I went there a lot! Ask them! It might pay to take someone who can speak vietnamese with you for translations. I took my driver the first time, then they just knew my order eventually...

Driver via hotel = $15USD or so for the whole day. Found a tad pricey for what I'd received throughout Vietnam, but didn't have the time to go out and barter. Driver was friendly but relaxed. Watch out though, I found he'd take me through certain routes because he 'needed' to, but really gave locals the opportunity to try sell me things. I'd find myself being shown how to make essences then all of a sudden, I'd be looking at someone selling me postcards, paintings whatever while my driver was just sitting casually within the store staring back at me. So I just took it as an opportunity to chat with locals and gain some insight into their way of life

Aside from that, hotel is very nice! Breakfast is tasty (and free as part of the deal I got with hotel) and a lot of options both western or traditional. I went for plenty of rounds of banana choc pancakes, eggs and Vietnamese dishes. Really tasty and made to order. Location wise, it's a bit of a walk to the Emperors (about 10-15 mins), but it gives you the chance to just soak in more of Hue, because it's beautiful

When checking out, the hotel let me store my things there while I tiki-toured some more and when I came back, I was pouring sweat that they let me into a room that was free to freshen up before hitching a ride back to the train station to leave for Hoi An. Absolutely wonderful of them!

I highly recommend Serene place without any hesitation!

42217,"I booked a room at this hotel for a three-night stay on the basis of the very good reviews on Tripadvisor. I wondered if it could be as good as the review suggested. It is. The quality of this hotel is better than many other much more expensive alternatives.
As other reviews have pointed out the location of the hotel is less than perfect, down a narrow lane which when rain falls becomes muddy and covered with puddles. It is however in the centre of the ‘Tourist area” and there are many cafes, restaurants, bars etc in the surrounding area. However it is worth navigating the lane for the quality of the hotel when you arrive.
I had booked a front facing room on a higher floor. The room was large, very clean and with modern furniture. The bed was very comfortable. A computer was provided in the room and wifi was free, fast and stable. The air con was easily controllable and quiet. The water pressure in the shower good and warm water arrived very quickly. My room rate included breakfast . This provided both western and Vietnamese options, and I tried both during my stay, there is also a range of fruit and breads and pastries to which you help yourself buffet style. Overall the breakfast was good without being exceptional.
However what was in my view exceptional was the professionalism, efficiency, friendliness and helpfulness of the staff – all of the staff. I visit many hotels for both business and pleasure, some of them far more expensive that the Serene Palace; some have one or two staff whom one remembers for their efficiency or helpfulness, but I have never stayed in any hotel where ALL the staff have been so exceptional in both the performance of their duties, in their friendliness, whilst never being intrusive, and in going the “extra mile” to help.

The shower was the best we have had so far in our week and a half travelling around Vietnam. The staff are so helpful, the offered us a few options for touring Hue and the DMZ but without pressure so once we had thought about it we booked a private tour to the DMZ for $100 for both of us. It was very worth it. Our guide, Tom, was from Dong Ha, had impeccable English and was in the area in the War and spoke from first hand experience. He took us to parts of the Vinh Moc tunnels that you don't normally see on a guided tour (because they were pitch black!).
The staff also went to the train station and bought our tickets to Hanoi for us to save us the hassle of going out to the station (more time for soghtseeing). I've had a bad cold since arriving and the restaurant staff kindly brought me a ginger, lemon and honey tea after seeing me suffer...A very welcome surprise!

42186,"I'm terribly lazy at writing reviews, but the service and attitude at this hotel was so excellent I simply have to add my comment. We arrived early in the morning after an awful night at sleeper bus (I'd never choose that again...). I had got sick in the bus plus we felt tired and dirty, so I asked if they'd have a room available - and they didn't only give us a room immediately but also upgraded to a bigger room with a balcony, and all that free of charge! We really appreciated that. In general, all the staff was very friendly, helpful, always greeting us with a smile. Also the restaurant staff was great. We don't usually like to use hotel restaurants, but since the breakfast had been excellent and we had read some good reviews about the food, we decided to dine there. The reviews were correct: food was tasty and there were enough choices for vegetarians as well, but again the best thing was the service, quick, friendly and even more: we had been given discount coupons on arrival but we had forgotten them totally, and were thus expecting to pay the normal price - but the waitress who recognized us from the breakfast gave the discount automatically! What could be better service? I wish I could remember her name so I could address my thanks to her.
All in all, we were happy with our stay. As said our room was very spacious, beds were comfortable and air conditioning worked well.

The location is great. It is near a lot of nice restaurants and the back packer street. You can walk to the river front and to the citadel. It is located in a quiet alley so there is not much noise from the street at night.

The hotel arranged a car for us and it took approx 30 min to get there - very nice to get a break from all the cultural sightseeing and relax on the beach for some hours.

42186,"Don't even think about booking at a different hotel! We stayed at the Serene Palace for 5 nights, and it was one of the best hotel experiences we ever had. If there was a six star option, they would have got it. Although being a big hotel, every staff member knew us by name, and cared personally for our well being and good time. We booked several day tours through the reception, and they were all for a fair price, and most of them (all but one, that was a group tour with an external company) were of superb quality.
The rooms are big, with all the amenities you need. You are given a free plate of fruit every day, along with the regular water bottles. They even have bathrobes, which are not common in hotels in this price range.
The restaurant is hands down the best in the city, and we ate several meals there. The local food is of top quality, and in very cheap prices. The included breakfast is also very good, and you can get some good Vietnamese coffee. The best aspect in the restaurant though is the amazing staff, commandeered by the lovely and very professional Hien (Sally). You are treated as one of the family. I was sick one day, and kept getting free ginger-lemon tea, during dinner, and even to my room. When we left for tour, even at 6:30am, there was always breakfast, and we were always handed a bag of fresh fruit for the day. We were very sad to leave all our new friends when we continued our trip - tears were shed on both sides.

42186,"As with all the other reviews, we found this place absolutely faultless. Prior to even arriving they sent emails about airport transfers rather than us having to contact them. They replied emails very fast and transfers were easy. Every single employee from the receptionist to the housekeeping, waitresses and drivers were very friendly and easy to talk to. Special thanks to Mary, the guy and girl at the front desk who talked to us about the tombs, and the two waitress who served us!

The front desk staff spoke fluent English and were very helpful - they helped us book things and recommended restaurants and attractions. When we were running out of time to go to the tombs, they arranged an early schedule prior to our train so we could visit and make the most of our time.

The restaurant had fantastic service and one of the best meals we've had in Vietnam. My fav was the pomelo salad and my bf loved the bun bo hue. Breakfast was also excellent with great coffee, fruit & whatever you'd like to order.

Everything was very thoughtfully considered such as the slippers in the room being larger sizes (we're both tall with bigger feet than Vietnamese people), fresh fruit and juice on arrival and the air con in the room already on as we checked in. It's these little details that set Serene apart from the rest.

The only issue was I booked a double and was meant to get a king sized bed but ours was two twin mattresses put together.

The breakfast is fabulous and I had several other meals at the restaurant and loved them! Staff are very good and they can speak good English making it easy to communicate. They arranged transport for me, etc. My room was spacious and the air conditioning worked well and the bed was very comfortable and wonderful shower!!!

42186,"Serene Hotel – Hue

I thought our last hotel was superb (Royal River in Hoi An), but the Serene Palace in Hue is almost as good at only half the price (US$26). I believe that if you book direct you can get it even cheaper. I booked the Serene Hotel in Hanoi through the desk here and they gave me a small discount to the internet price plus free pick-up.

I don't need to dwell on the service here as every other review has done, except to say they take a personal interest in every guest, and the service is second to non.

Apart from the service, the restaurant is the prize asset. You can get a six course fixed menu dinner for two for 259,000 vnd, and it's an amazing meal. Other dishes available average around 60,000. Breakfast is a-la cart, eggs to order or just about anything else you fancy. Just ask Ami.

We stayed for four days. On arrival we were upgraded to a deluxe room with a bath. We arrived around 8.30am and were able to check in immediately. We take the evening train to Hanoi, and arranged checkout for 8pm.

The rooms are a decent size and come with a small desk complete with desktop computer, table and 2 chairs, wardrobe, luggage rack, two bedside tables with draws, robes, heaps of bathroom product, fresh fruit bowl every morning… basically everything you have come to expect from a hotel twice the price. Wifi is super fast

The location is good, with several cafes in the lane and plenty more around the corner.

42156,"I stayed here with my sister on the last night of a week-long stint in Vietnam. It was great! The ""Twin-share"" room was actually 2 double beds, and we had a fridge, kettle, coffee & tea provided, safety deposit box, tv with cable, and a computer (never seen that before in a hotel room!). The room was clean and comfortable, and the shower was great. Breakfast was included, and we could order whatever we wanted from the menu (both Vietnamese and western food) and they'd bring it out for us - eat as much as you like.

When we first got there we were a little confused about how to get to the hotel, as it was down an alleyway, but it was so close to everything! After we had checked in (they gave us cool towels and a drink of fresh passion fruit juice while we waited), they provided us with a map of Hue and circled the attractions we wanted to see. They also offered a trip to see the Pagoda and Ancient Citadel with a free taxi to the boats and private boat trip up and down the river for $20 USD total - and our driver came to pick us up just 15 minutes later! It was a great service. They also helped us to book a private car from Hue to Lang Co beach and then Ba Na hills, before heading to the airport in Da Nang. The driver was a bit pricey ($67 USD), but he gave us time to stop and take photos whenever we wanted, and played some cool music in his car. He also watched our bags while we were at Ba Na, and drove very well. We didn't mind too much, because in total we spent $32 AUD for the night for the ""twin-share"" room (breakfast included).

42156,"This is a really clean hotel. I mean really clean!
The staff are excellent Location is good. There is a Karoke bar next door but our room was at the back of the hotel on the 7th floor. It was very quiet.
The bar doesn't seem to make much noise anyway.
Our bed was very very comfy and huge.
The hotels restaurant is #1 on TA. So very easy if you want to eat at the hotel. They have a buy one, get one free mojito cocktail special all night and guests of the hotel get 10% off the bill. These deals make for an extremely cheap meal.
The hotel is in a good location. Come out of the front entrance and turn left and there are some lovely little cafes. If you turn right you are heading in the direction of the river. It's lovely to walk along the river in the evening towards the night market that starts at 7pm. The staff are very helpful with hints and directions.
We paid US$50 to have a full day private tour in a hotel car. I don't think this was really the best way to see Hue. We had to purchase our own combination ticket. (VND 280 each) this included 2 tombs and the citadel. There are two types of combination tickets. One has an extra temple. Honestly three temples is plenty. The problem with the hotel tour is that the driver has very little English so really gives no information to you at all. We had no idea what we were driving past or where we were driving to. Apparently you can pay more for a guide (US$30). It's all a bit expensive. I think you could find a driver who spoke English yourself and get a better tour.

Located in a relatively quiet alleyway, with a karaoke place beside it; despite that it was never noisy and I felt safe walking home at night. Got a nice spacious twin room that was clean and bright with comfy bed and good air conditioning in the hot summer weather. Beautiful room. Water pressure was also good (some budget hotels have really weak water pressure) which made baths so much more enjoyable amidst the summer heat. Breakfast was simple yet delicious with a good mix of food choices, juices and local fruits. Staff were friendly and accommodating to my request of a cup of hot water for my daily dosage of wolfberries tea with a smile.

42156,"My fiancé and I have just recently spent 1 night at Serene Palace. We were in a city view double room on the top 7th floor.

The hotel is set just back from the main strip in a small side street. This certainly helped with street noise. I would recommend, though, to get a room higher up to avoid any possible noise from the karaoke club next door or the online gaming joint across the road. We certainly heard nothing from either.

The whole hotel looked very recently renovated/new. Our room was very clean and nicely decorated with a high ceiling. The king sized bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was fitted out with modern appliances.

However, most outstanding was the friendliness and efficiency of the staff, both front of house and wait staff. We shared many laughs as I tried out my basic Vietnamese! They also organised a car transfer to Hoi An for $65. This was great value as our fantastic driver, Huy, was happy to stop anywhere we wished.

Restaurant: We are here multiple times and their prices are very fair and relatively cheap, what surprised me the most was they gave us 10% discounts on meals which was very nice and unexpected.

Breakfast: The breakfast is the best! In my 4 nights here I probably ate 4 mangos just at breakfast the fruit selection is amazing! The breakfast menu is fairly large and you can order how much you want, and when your full you still get offered to order more :)

Room: Room was very clean and we no problems at all, I'd admit I had a 10 minute shower and the hot water showed no signs of running out. I found it had awesome WIFI being able to load youtube and blog.

Staff: The staff are the absolute best part of the hotel, the best hospitality I have ever experienced. Very friendly and speak good English, I never once felt like I was being sold to It felt like we were the king and queen of the palace.

We stayed one night at the Serene Hotel in Hue. It is located about 1.5km from the Forbidden Purple Palace (Imperial Citadel), so an easy cab ride or you could just walk.

The hotel is on a bumpy back-street, but the area is safe to walk in at night. The rooms were good, including a bath. An under-sized room safe was a minor annoyance, but the security was good in the hotel.

The staff were friendly, competent and able to give a good recommendation for a boat ride to visit a pagoda out of town for 20USD.

42095,"We stayed here for four nights in March and really enjoyed it -- the room was spacious and comfortable, but above all, the ladies at the front desk were extremely helpful and friendly. They helped us to arrange train tickets and rental bicycles and in general were very willing to help with anything we could have possibly needed. A few specific pros: we thought the bed was very comfortable, we liked having a PC in the room so we could research our day's activities, and the location of the hotel was a tiny bit off the beaten path but a) still very convenient and b) not in the heart of what felt like the most touristy area. Breakfast was quite good, with plentiful food and a lot of variety in what was offered. Also, at $2 per kilo, we were very appreciated of their quick and capable laundry service. Minor cons: the room had just the slightest mildewy pong to it, although we quickly got used to it once in the room so it wasn't really an issue for us. The bathtub was very small and for some reason didn't have a thing to hold the shower head, so showering was a two-person affair with one person holding the shower head for the other.

I choose the serene based on trip adviser reviews .After a long day of a flight which was delayed 8 hours my husband arrived by transfer arranged by hotel very tired and hungry for our 5 nights in Hue ,check in very very quick with welcoming drink and very friendly staff ,we where shown to our room which was a city room with balcony and bath ,the room was very clean and spacious we where both so hungry we chose to eat before unpacking ,which we did in the hotel the food was lovely ( I will reveiw seperate) Upon returning to the room I took a bath the bath was a spa type bath which was the smallest bath I have ever bathed in I am 5.2 small build and could not relax in the bath as the spa jets stuck into me after a very short bath I jumped into bed exhursted the bed was very firm but I noticed the pillows themselfs where very old and stained ,my husband however had noticed he was being bitten once we looked the top sheet was absolutlet covered in tiny mozziesupon looking the ceiling and room was covered with them ,by this time I myself had been bitten all over my neck and sholders .We persumed that they had come in through the doors when we first looked at the balcony area although the door was only open for seconds ,upon looking again we saw that the balcony was covered with them probably attracted to the neon signs of the kareoke club which joined onto the hotel.My husband made the decision that this hotel was not for us so had a chat with reception who was so lovely about the whole thing my husband explained it was not the hotel at fault here but that we where used to a larger hotel in a quieter location ,The staff recomended a hotel and telephoned them and secured a very good rate for our 5 night stay ,Cannot fault the reception staff they where simply wonderful.

42036,"If you are a young couple and willing to pay a little extra, get the the double double with city view. The view from the 7th floor was definately worth it! The complimentary Breakfast was the best and most diverse we've experienced during our 3 weeks, and the waiters kindly catered to our every needs. The room was large, bright and very clean. Our only complaints were that the shower door did not keep the water inside the shower cubicle, so a bit of the shower flooded every time, and the wifi often was quite weak. The reception staff were also very friendly and helpful, assisting us to find a last minute transport. They spoke and understood English very well . On the downside, each time I spoke to someone , I had to re-explain the whole situation as there was little communication between staff members, and because of their recommendation, we waited for almost 4 hours at Hue Train Station (5:30-9am) because they said a journey from Phong Nha to Hue would take over 5-6 hours by car (it only took over 3!)

My partner & I were blown away by the beautiful flowers, decorated cake and brilliantly arranged towels (looked like two puppies lying down!) that were waiting on the bed when we returned. There were even candles & a lighter for the cake!

I have never had that level of service even when staying at a 5 star hotel.

Wood floors, a complimentary computer as well as free WiFi, good size jacuzzi tub and a small balcony (perfect for launching a drone for aerial city pics 😏).

42036,"We had booked this hotel at the suggestion of a tour agent we ended up not using from Danang. We typically stay in smaller guest houses or home stays so this came across as a ""hotel"" which is what it is!
Pros: Our pick up from the train station was right there when we arrived. The rooms are clean, spacious, with amenities one would expect from a hotel. The staff are very helpful, friendly and ready to assist with anything you might need. Breakfast was VERY good with many options from Western food to the common Vietnamese breakfast Pho. Location is very central to visit the local sites and we were within walking distance of many good restaurants in the area.
Cons: We had laundry done here and it was the first time in all our times in SE Asia that it didn't come back looking or smelling clean. We did bring this to the attention of the hotel who kindly waved the charges, offered to get it redone and truly responded professionally. This really should not reflect on the hotel itself as they send it out and apparently have been using the same provider for over 1 year without complaint. Perhaps we just hit a bad day!

42036,"We had such an excellent experience with Serene Hotel in Hanoi, there was no question we were going to stay here. On our brief stay in Hue, the hotel had everything we could hope for- comfort with close proximity to the Imperial Palace and access to local cuisine. Nancy and the staff was warm and welcoming, a standard we pleasantly discovered consistent with Serene Hotel.

When we arrived to Hue by bus, it dropped it us off in front of a popular bustling backpacker hostel. My first inkling was “Uh oh, I hope the hotel isn’t in a party neighborhood.” Luckily, it was nearby, just a couple of blocks away tucked away on a muted side street. We had a pleasantly quiet room on the 8th floor with a great view, a perfect place to rest up after a sleeper bus ride.

The Imperial Palace and The Forbidden Purple City was easily accessible. We hired a tricycle driver just outside the hotel for the day because we figured there will be a lot of walking. For 200,000 dong (he asked for a 50, 000 tip, so be aware when you negotiate) he toured us around the main sites and dropped us back at the hotel.

Within a couple of blocks, there are a variety of highly rated Trip Advisor restaurants so we were close proximity to a selection of recommended culinary experience. After a day of walking around the immense Imperial Palace, you’ll be glad that you are a short distance walk from a delicious meal before retreating to the comforts of the hotel.

With only 24 hours in town, we covered a lot of ground.

42036,"When the taxi veered into the little alley where this hotel is located we were not sure what to expect.... But we were more than pleasantly surprised. We were greeted by the doorman in his official doorman's uniform and were escorted to the reception where a legion of staff was waiting to help us. Refreshments, a towel and fruit were immediately brought to us while they were handling in check procedures.
Another staff member provided us with tourist information, maps and arranged our bicycles. We already made our plans, but I am sure they would have gone out of their way to help us with bookings etc. if we had wanted to. Very good level of English spoken by the staff as well.
Location of the hotel is excellent, close to the sights and to the restaurants.

Room was spacious, well appointed and clean!!! Bathroom was unexpectedly large. Fresh fruit and tea making facilities in the room.
Our room was at the back of the hotel on the 5th floor; so we had a view. Guest who stayed at the front of the hotel had a nicer view, but then you have to pay extra.

The only comment I would like to make is about the restaurant. As it is next to the lobby and the staircase it is not the cosiest of places. Breakfast was ok with a nice selection of fruits and a choice of cooked breakfast. I had a look in the kitchen, which could be more professional and clean....
Lots of pots and plans on the floor, the Vietnamese way, but I think this hotel can do better.

The front desk staff was uniformly excellent. Polite, efficient, gracious, and when they talk to you they give you their full attention. They seem very well trained. We were immediately greeted with refreshments--fresh fruit and juices--when we arrived, along with the wifi password, which I thought was a nice touch.

Room was very clean and well maintained. I was surprised to see a complimentary desktop computer with internet access. We ended up not using it but were pleased to have it available.

There were other amenities available that we appreciated. They left fresh fruit for us in the room. They rented us a motorbike. The next day, when it was raining, they arranged for a car and driver to take us around. The car/driver was a package deal with a preset menu of sightseeing sites, but it seemed reasonably priced (I think around $45 for the day). We had the car to ourselves and it was a roomy, comfortable Toyota crossover-like vehicle that was very clean. The staff even thought to loan us umbrellas to take with us for the day.

The restaurant in the hotel is excellent, with same superb service. I understand that the restaurant has a separate TripAdvisor listing, so I put my (glowing) review of the restaurant there. But it's worth mentioning that it's really convenient to have a good restaurant right there in the hotel.

Laundry was charged by the kg and very cheap - we did a week's washing for four adults for only USD3. The use of the in-room computer was a great plus.
We booked the pagoda and the 3 tombs private day tour with the hotel as well as a private car from Hue to Hoi An. Our driver on both days was Mr Nguyen.

He showed us the best Vietnamese coffee in the region (and he was right) and had the most delicious Mi Quang noodles for lunch.
Not far from the hotel on Le Loi is a small family run bakery which sells the most delicious doughnuts. We bought a whole bag of doughnuts and assorted pastries for US$2.

We had arranged with Jenny to be picked up at airport and Mr. Ninh was our driver; he was so friendly and nice that we requested him to drive us on the transfer from Hue to Hoi An that we had also arranged with Jenny. We cannot say enough good things about the excellent staff of the hotel and the restaurant and the facilities of the hotel. We had a Superior Double on the 7th floor and the room was immaculate, huge, PC on desk, divine bed with extra pillows, big bathroom with nice fixtures and tub/shower combo. Arriving tired and not looking forward to a walk to find dinner, we were so surprised to see that we could dine in the restaurant. We met An and Thanh-Thanh the first evening and they recommended we try Hoi An specialty of fried pancakes filled with pork and shrimp. It was delightful and this was the beginning of our love affair with the staff and the restaurant. We actually ate here every night and invited friends to join us one evening. Wine list is good too which is unusual in Vietnam. Breakfast was a feast of many fruits, juices, coffee, tea, delicious fresh baked baguettes and either traditional Pho noodle soup or western egg dishes with bacon or sausage. Sally, An, Thuy and Thanh-Thanh became our friends and each morning instantly brought my tea with milk and sugar and my husband's coffee. The hotel is modern, comfortable and since we had noise issues in some ways with every hotel we stayed in the echoing that some guests noticed did not bother us enough to complain about and we did not hear a rooster. It is not billed as 4 star, but very clearly is 3 star and exactly a good value at $32 per night including the huge breakfast. We cannot agree with some reviewers who were disappointed that it was not 4 star. We think it was incredible value for what we paid in other places, like Hanoi, Hoi An, Dalat and Sai Gon. Jenny at the front desk can arrange any number of tours and is very efficient, answering all questions that we had from afar as we planned our month trip to Vietnam. The hotel is centrally located, and although the street is not impressive, most hotels like this are tucked away in unassuming little streets like this and it does not take away from the charm. We were well satisfied and would return again and again if we could. We actually reluctantly took our leave of the staff.

Staff is very attentive professional and well trained. You are initially greeted with a drink and fruit and the breakfast is so well organized. I wish all hotels would make the fruit, real juice, and hot drinks as a buffet and then the rest by a la carte ordering - there is much less waste.
The only elevator can be a bit slow when everyone is trying to use it at once, but oh well then we took the stairs.

If you choose this hotel demand a high floor in the back of the hotel. Stayed on the 3rd floor and you could hear everything from the lobby. While restaurant gets good reviews it is nothing special. The Vietnamese dishes are watered down versions to serve a foreign clientele. Vietnamese dishes are rather flavorless which is a pity in s country with a spectacular spice and herb culinary tradition. We found this to be the case with most restaurants in the prime tourist area. Best head for street food, you'll get better food at lower price. And no you won't get sick!

42005,"If you want excellent value, style and a great night's sleep, look no further than the Serene Palace in Hue. This hotel is run by an efficient team, all be it slightly OTT, that also doesn't miss a thing!
It's location is right in the centre of all the restaurants and bars. The beds are firm and extremely comfortable and the room was modern and very stylish. Even the breakfast was spot on.. in that they catered for European and Vietnamese tastes. There was a widescreen TV that showed popular movies and documentaries plus they also provided a PC in the room.
The only negative point was that the hot water ran cold when we needed a shower in the afternoon or evenings.

42005,Stayed here for two nights 13 - 15 Jan in a Standard room. No balcony with just a view out the back but given the small amount of time we stayed in the room it's probably better to save a bit of money. Room was very nice and clean with good shower. The hotel is quite new so all clean. Good breakfast included. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Only down-side I can say is that the location is about 10 minute walk from the main area of bars/restaurants and in a rather dark side street.

42005,"We booked to stay in the hotel from 7th Jan to 9th Jan and also booked pickup from the airport to the hotel. Reminded Jenny a few days before our arrival. There was no one waiting to pick us up when we got out of the arrival lounge. Called the hotel after 10 minutes and were told the pickup will be arriving late and need to wait another 20 minutes. Pickup finally arrive but was more upset when we saw a 10 seater was sent to fetch 12 of us plus our luggages. Imagine the driver trying to squeeze 12 adults plus luggages into a 10 seater. This was despite repeated reminder to the hotel that there are 12 of us with luggages and assurances from the hotel that they will send a proper pickup. Had to call the hotel again to ask for an extra taxi to fit in all of us.
Was ready to confront the hotel management upon arrival at the hotel but all was forgiven when they set up a good reception on our arrival and took up the cost of the extra taxi.
This is a great hotel for the price that is charged. A four star service for a two star price. Breakfast was superb with a good range of fresh fruits and fresh juice to boot. Breakfast main course is ala carte with delicious local and western choices. Top this up with the smiling service by Lucy and you cannot ask for a better start for the day.
Rooms were clean and well appointed like a four star room.
The duty manager Mary apologised about the bungled pickup again when we were checking out but all was already madeup by our great stay at the hotel.

Rooms were spanking clean, fixtures and bedroom furniture were in mint-conditions. The best thing about the hotel was the staff. They were extremely pleasant, attentive without going over board. Services in all areas were spot on, from restaurant to car rental, taxi, tour info, and pricing.

I checked in after noon, agreed to rent a scooter for a full day. When I received the scooter, the staff automatically cut down the price in half without being asked. The next day, I wanted to ride out at 8 PM, an employee lent me her own scooter without charging. Transportation desk explained multiple options to get around, and was knowledgeable about the city.

Services were on par, if not higher than some 5 star hotels I'd been to; and it's not just the receptionists. Restaurant hosts, waiters, doormen, transportation employees, room maintenance, etc. - all provided consistent services. The approach was low key and non-invasive, but highly efficient.

Breakfast consisted of self-service food/drinks combined with ordered items. I saw other guests ordering more than one item, no extra charge.

Dinner was excellent, Viet dishes were authentic, some were lightly modified to suit a more generic taste (less spicy), all were excellent.

Welcoming and goodbyes were warm and quick. This hotel has it all: Location, facilities, and best of all, excellent staff.

41974,"The staff really make this hotel. Very friendly, proactive, and always trying hard. Good value for price.

The rooms are inconsistent. We reserved two of the same type; one had a glass shower, and the other only a tub with a hand shower wand but nowhere to hang it to shower standing up. Very odd, and needs at least a wall hook for the shower head. Similarly, one room was missing a bedside table. The rooms have PCs that, because they're shared, give me the virus/malware heebie-jeebies. We didn't use ours. The wifi was decent (a bit flaky) in the common areas but didn't penetrate to our room very well (it showed signal in the room but actual data transfer was iffy until we went outside the room).

Breakfast (included) was a small fruit buffet (but the fruit were all fresh, ripe and of excellent quality!) as well as a menu you could order from. We mostly stuck to the noodle soups (like bun bo hue -- delicious, and not dumbed down for the western palate). The eggs were perfectly good as well, although one day the ""sausage"" accompanying mine was half of a cold hot dog! The dishes to-order are small, but it's fine to order two.

The location is good, on a semi-paved back lane (meaning relatively quiet) but a very short walk to tons of cafes, restaurants, and bars. It's not a place where one can hail a taxi, but the hotel will happily call one to arrive in just a couple minutes.

We ate dinner at the hotel restaurant one night. It was pretty good, but nowhere near as good as the locals' place we went for lunch for local specialties.

The only major problem we had was the playlist of the same bad Christmas music, at high volume, on repeat at all meals at the restaurant (including breakfast).

The service was very helpful - and delivered with good humour. This applied to advice given for seeing the Imperial Citadel and planning trips outside of town as well as in the restaurant.

We have only two complaints to an otherwise faultless stay:
1) The hotel arranged a driver to take us on to Hoi An. The route taken included the spots we had been advised and requested. However, on arrival in Hoi An the drivers ""friend"" hopped on in - supposedly under the guise that as a local she would help find our hotel. In reality it was purely as a sales pitch for her family tailoring shop. This may have been a purely personal initiative of the driver and not sanctioned by Serene Palace but I mention this so that the management will also know what is being done in their name.
2) There was a follow-up email to request that if we had no issues with our stay could we please give a 5* review. The 5* rating I have given therefore relates to the stay itself and not the overall experience as the driver and email were too pushy for my personal taste.",50,12,"London, United Kingdom",8,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/914charlesr,Charles R,41974,Very Good but...,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293926-d4357913-Reviews-or1610-Hue_Serene_Palace_Hotel-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html#REVIEWS

It was big, spacious with furniture that was well-appointed. There was even a desktop computer! This hotel seems relatively new and everything was in good condition and working order. Staff spoke good English and were very helpful in giving suggestions and directions. Breakfast was great and the food we had at the restaurant for lunch and dinner was some of the best we had in Vietnam and were of reasonable prices! It's really convenient to have stay and dine at the same place. The only (minor) minus point is the location. It's a bit far out and a taxi is required to reach the Citadel.

41974,"Serene Palace hotel attracted us by amazing quality record to start from.
We just turned up without reservation on Saturday morning straight from the night train, were greeted by welcome drink and a plate of fruit. Unfortunately, no rooms free! By the time we drank the juice and used their excellent Wifi, the manager Marie came up with cancellation: room became available but was above our budget. It was huge family room with two double beds, flat screen TV, computer in room, complimentary corner with fruit/drink/water, bath robes, you name it! (203 just above the front entrance). Although last room available, Marie reduced price to a very fare $30 which we could not refuse.
We loved the room and friendly staff so much, we stayed extra night!
The hotel is very well built with quality finishings, tasteful decor and immaculate hygiene!
Organised DMZ tour for us and onward taxi to Hoi An, both very successfully!
Breakfast perfect with plenty of fruit, fresh juices, omelets, Vietnamese offerings, nice spacious back of reception area.
Wifi throughout, computer in room worked well too.
Location down the tiny alley did not detract from hotel but made it quieter, even though we initially were worried our room was right over the entrance. The area just at the end of this alley IS the centre of tourist life at night!

41974,"The service in this comfortable hotel is awesome. Although we were by no means the only guests, the friendly young ladies who work on reception and in the breakfast room went out of their way to address us by our first names.

An elevator took us to our large, comfortable room with its king-sized double bed. It was equipped with a safe, tea/coffee , water, and fruit (free) but we had to plug the kettle in the bathroom. The bathroom has a walk-in rainforest shower, ample hot water but little room to place toiletries around the wash basin.

There is a good Wi-Fi signal throughout the property, and an added bonus for us was the flat screen TV that could pick up both BBC World and the ever-optimistic Russian First Channel. No CNN!

Breakfast is great: a buffet of exotic fruits, yoghurt etc. In addition you can order as many items as you like from the a la carte menu, including cornflakes with cold milk and omelettes.

The hotel is located in a quiet backstreet within walking distance of the buzz in the street with the DMZ Bar and Backpackers Hostel.

Hotel staff arranged a car and local guide (Amy) for a tour of the DMZ sites for $US 130 which was more comprehensive that the consolidated minibus tours and afforded us the opportunity to ask many questions of our guide, and to include a special visit to the Mines Advisory Centre in Dong Ha. British charity MAG are doing great work helping to clear unexploded ordinance. Hotel staff also arranged door to door transportation to the Hotel Kiman that they recommended and booked for us in Hoi An. For $US 65 we thus had a car available all day, and could stop for lunch in Danang and spend time exploring the caves of Marble Mountain 10 km south of Danang.

One point though and this is not the fault of the hotel, they arranged for driver to take us from the hotel to our next stop in Hoi an.

Wonderful friendly, helpful staff and a special mention to Jenny and Sally.
Bright, clean, modern and really well maintained this hotel will surely please all. You have a lift to all floors and thank goodness as we were on the sixth.

Our room was super. Big and bright with a full patio door to a balcony with a decent enough view....even if it was of the rooftops! But the weather was not kind to us so sitting and chatting on the balcony was not on the cards.

The bed was king size, very comfy with a choice of pillows made for a very good nights sleep.
The bathroom matched....modern and spotless. No less than three ladies came in the morning to clean! Flat screen TV with a decent selection of channels.
And what is that I see on the table? A full on computer in every room!! Other hotels please take note. A truly excellent idea!

I am a bit fussy about breakfast as this for me is the best meal of the day. I had all I needed here and a nice touch is that the girls will serve you whatever you need. Fruit, bread and other small items you help yourself to....but ask and it will be served.

Any drawbacks? We did not like the rough, potholed lane this lovely hotel is down. It is in bad shape and when it rained (as it did!) you could be splashed by motorbikes and they do come really, really close to you.

The staff was very accommodating and gave personalized service. When I was delayed in arrival by a day and had pre-booked and paid for my room through Agoda, the hotel agreed to refund my first night by 50% which was more than generous. Mary, who works at the front desk, greeted me upon arrival with a smile and made me feel welcome.

She recommended the restaurant on the first floor for dinner. I am not usually in the habit of eating in hotel restaurants as the food is often mediocre and over priced, but I checked on TA and the place was rated #1 so thought I would give it a shot.

My dinner was wonderful and the service I received from Sally was terrific. She made menu recommendations and spent time with me telling me about local specialities. The breakfasts included in the price were also very nice with lots of options.

The WiFi is amazing. Using the wired connection that connects to the computer provided, I did a speed test that hit 25mbps. That is an amazing speed in Vietnam, let alone Hue. My 4 star Hanoi hotel barely hits 1mbps.

Breakfast is a huge spread. Order as much as you like, and the staff will accommodate as far as possible to your requests. The fried rice with garlic and egg is delicious.

41944,"We stayed at the Serene Palace for 8 nights and really enjoyed the hotel, the food, and especially the excellent staff. Our spacious, comfortable room with a balcony overlooking the town was a great place for exploring the city. When you step out the front door of the hotel into the lane you are already in authentic Vietnam with families going about their daily lives, roosters strutting in the fenced gardens, and you are within walking distance to the restaurants and many of the city sites. Well, on the hot, humid days the inexpensive taxis are everywhere to zip you onwards to the next site if you don't feel like walking.

I recommend that on your first trip to the Imperial Palace/Citadel that you ask the front desk staff to call you a taxi and tell the driver to take you to the gate that is open for ticket sales…there’s only 1 gate open and it is an immense site. You won’t want to waste so much time trying to find how to get in like we did the first time we went! Try to budget 30 minutes to watch the fabulous costume dance and music performance at the Royal Theatre – shows are only at 2:30 and 3:30 INSIDE the Imperial Palace complex.

The front desk staff will arrange for a car and driver to take you on the 4 site excursion to the Thien Mu Pagoda, The Lang Minh Tomb, the Lang Khai Dinh Tomb, and the Lang Tu Duc Tomb. You’ll read that you can take a river boat or ride your bike, but don’t believe it if you want to see everything on a 1 day excursion. It takes the best part of the day to see these sites and that is with a car/driver who will drive through several small villages and drop you in just the right spot for each site. By the way, don’t panic if you feel as though you are running out of time before you arrive at the Lang Tu Duc tomb – it is mostly under construction but the BEST part of it is open and very close to the entrance so you can fully enjoy it in 15 minutes or so.

We loved sitting on our balcony after a day’s exploring to watch the evening return of the birds just as the sun sets and to observe the kids playing and the night lights coming on in the city around us. I realize this is a bit odd for a hotel review but so much of our exploration was made pleasurable by the hotel staff that I wanted to share this since it can be difficult trying to find out this information while you are in Hue.",40,315,"Vancouver, Canada",276,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheReids,TheReids,41944,a great choice,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293926-d4357913-Reviews-or1680-Hue_Serene_Palace_Hotel-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html#REVIEWS

41944,"Located in a very narrow side street but just a five minute walk to everything....only a minute to great banana fritters though! This hotel is relatively new with large, clean and well appointed rooms including free wi-fi, which appears to be standard in Vietnam and Cambodia. The staff here are friendly and very obliging with organising tours at the last minute and refunding part of the cost due to the limited time available.

Just around the corner is a great bar and cocktails at Hot Tuna. Try the MaiTai for $4usd where you can sit upstairs and watch all the action. The Hang Me Me is just down the road. They are known for there Vietnamese cakes but are actually steamed rice pancakes with shrimps and pork. Worth trying.

The breakfast at the Serene was very good especially their local noodle soup, Bun Bo. It's better than Pho as it's a little more flavoursome.

We had two nights in Hue but would suggest that you spend three nights if you want to visit the demilitarised zone or visit all of the tombs in Hue. We went to the citadel, pagoda and the tomb of Tu Duc which was worth seeing. We went via boat to the pagoda and then had a driver pick us up there rather than being on the boat for an hour. We'd recommend doing this rather than the boat trip up and down the Perfume River and then getting a car to take you around the tombs. Once you've done the river one way you've seen it all.

The hotel also arranged our driver for the trip from Hue and Hoi An. This is a good way to see the scenery and you stop of at a number of scenic sites including the lagoon, China Beach at Da Nang, the Pass and also Marble Mountain. This cost us $65usd for the three of us and we had Tre as our driver. He speaks very good English and has fun.

The boat waited for us at the pagoda & dropped us to the citadel & that was it. We paid to enter the citadel ourselves & made our own way back to the hotel. We also booked a taxi transfer from Hue to Hoi-An but later cancelled it as we booked a scooter ride tour transfer ourselves, which turned out to be the best part of our visit to Vietnam so far.",40,5,"Dublin, Ireland",12,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenfrancony,Jen O,41913,Beware of Sales Staff,NA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293926-d4357913-Reviews-or1700-Hue_Serene_Palace_Hotel-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html#REVIEWS

The city tour they recommended was fantastic and the private driver was great! Only bad thing was that the drive from Danang to Hue took at lot longer than we were expecting but it wasn't the hotel's fault, more our assumption that it would only take an hour whereas it took two and a half!
After we had left and travelled down to Hoi An, the staff at Serene were frantically trying to contact us at our new hotel. We thought perhaps we had left something behind, but there had been a mix up with our bill and we had overpaid by $10. They offered to have a driver bring it down to Hoi An for us!!

We also found the hotel excellent in arranging tours and airport transfers. They were able to do this competitively priced.

They arranged an amazing full day tour of the DMZ, Khe Sanh and Vinh Moc tunnels. Our driver was excellent and the guide provided so much information about the history. This was probably the highlight of our whole trip to Vietnam.

Can absolutely vouch for the great service from this energetic young team and the restaurant is one of the best that we came across in our three weeks in vietnam.
However it was a mismatch for us as retirees in that the ""comfortable"" bed so often mentioned in the reviews was in fact so hard that we were unable to lie comfortably on it. The staff did their best to help by providing extra quilts to make up sleeping pads but it still made for a couple of uncomfortable nights. We realised after we arrived that it was a haven for young fit backpackers who doubtless relished the otherwise wonderful service and amenities. We made the strong suggestion to the staff that they look at changing a few of the mattresses to less firm ones or at least purchase some foam sleeping pads as an option should they be requested - in fact a ""mattress menu"" could be quite a selling point.

I made my reservation by internet before I left home. From the outset they were very helpful with the booking and help with trips I wanted to make to areas around Hue.
When I arrived their friendliness and helpfulness went up a gear.Their whole team, receptionists, kitchen staff, waitresses, concierge have been imbued with this friendly service ethic.
The disappointment on the waitresses face when I couldn't finish my Pho(beef noodle soup) was entirely genuine..

41883,"This is my 5th time to Vietnam and this hotel is by far my favourite. My wife and I are on our honeymoon and stayed here for 4 nights. Service and value was probably the best I've had anywhere in any country. The staff were so friendly and helpful from the moment we arrived. They gave us a welcome drink and fruit upon arrival and took our bags to the room for us which was nice after our long bus trip. Our room was really nice, stylish and clean, as per the photos on Agoda. Soft comfy bed. Laura gave us lots of info about tours and what else to do in Hue. The BEST aspect of this hotel (other than the staff) was the breakfast. There were a lot of choices on the menu. The first morning we ordered 1 meal and 1 drink each then the waitress said ""anything else?""...turns out you can choose multiple dishes! So every morning I had, for example, bacon & eggs + banana pancake or cereal with yoghurt + fruit juice + cup of tea/coffee. Then you can also help yourself to the table fresh fruit, toast, tea & coffee refills! It was literally ""all-you-can-eat"". When you're thinking about the price of this hotel (already great value), consider this free delicious breakfast and how much it would cost if you ordered it at a restaurant outside the hotel. Every morning our rooms were cleaned before we came back from breakfast and there was complimentary fruit and bottled water waiting on our table (yes, more fruit!).
LOCATION: Down a quiet lane approx. 5 min walk from Pham Ngu Lao Street (the main tourist street with lots of restaurants & bars inc. DMZ bar). Perfect location as you don't get any noise from the bars but it's a close walk to them. Don't be fooled by the plain hotel exterior, the interior is beautiful. I'd recommend this hotel to anyone- cheap enough for backpackers to have a minor splurge and nice enough for a honeymoon!
P.S. We also had dinner at the hotel restaurant on the first night because we were too tired to go walk around. We had some Hue specialty dishes and it was some of the best food we had in Hue. Because the hotel is ""hidden away"", we were the only ones in the restaurant so the service was really quick.",50,57,"Brisbane, Australia",20,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W9960KGmichaell,Mike L,41883,"Our FAVOURITE hotel in Vietnam- LOVELY staff, HUGE breakfast!",Trip type: Traveled as a couple,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293926-d4357913-Reviews-or1740-Hue_Serene_Palace_Hotel-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html#REVIEWS

41883,"My partner and I stayed for 4 nights at the HUE Serene Palace. From the check-in through our departure everything reflected high quality, well trained staff, with incredible knowledge of their city as well as outstanding English language skills, sense of humor and degree of professionalism I have found only in Five Star properties during my years of travel and living in Vietnam.

We upgraded from a ""superior"" room to a more superior one (for five dollars more) and had a balcony, great morning light and a view of the city. Upper levels are better owing to construction and noisy karaoke nearby (the only downside of staying here)

Breakfast (included) was ample and good - not great but good - as the Vietnamese cuisine seems diluted for ""Western"" palates. Good variety, great fruit, lots of decent coffee and very friendly, warm waitstaff.

We arranged day trips (private boat rental, motorbikes and guide) and Laura and Emily (two of the many stars at the hotel) got us good price and even better quality (less expensive and safer options than elsewhere).

We had stayed at their sister hotel, Hanoi Charming 2 hotel, and the helpful staff over there had booked this hotel for us, and because of that we got a free upgrade to a room with a balcony.
The room was extremely clean and amazingly modern, which was our favorite part about our stay.
When we arrived there, I had started to become sick, and the staff were so helpful, they kept giving me ginger and lemon tea for my cold, and even on our last day, after we had checked out and were waiting for several hours before getting to the airport, the staff were still being extremely helpful, by providing me with ginger and lemon tea all day. Can't even begin to thank them enough, they are all wonderful people.
Breakfast was delicious and came with the room package, and they have a very clean modern restaurant, so you can just have lunch or dinner there if you don't feel like going out.
Location is really good as well, even though they are located in an alleyway, there were a few really funky looking coffee places down the road, but the Hotel is just walking distance from the main town.

41883,"My girlfriend and I spent 11 nights as guests at this hotel. While we have grown accustomed to receiving top-tier customer service in Vietnam, the staff at Serene Palace Hotel took it to a new level. Their smiles and greetings are genuine, and there isn't a much better feeling especially given our circumstances. My girlfriend had to spend a full week in the hospital in Hue, which the hotel staff were well aware of and helped coordinate. Each morning when I would return to the hotel for the great breakfast and a shower, members of the staff would individually come ask me how she was doing and if there was anything at all she needed or wanted. Even when I would say that she didn't want anything, they would still make up a bag of little snacks for me to bring her (the selection of hospital food in Hue is rather limited). A few of them even came to visit us in hospital outside of their working hours, bringing with them a hawaiian pizza (which my girlfriend had been craving badly) and a huge bunch of bananas (as I would bring a banana for her each morning from the hotel). We felt so comfortable and welcome at the hotel that we stayed for an additional 3 nights after she had been discharged from hospital, and again the treatment we received was excellent. The rooms are very stylish and comfortable, the free wifi was great, the advice and service was top-notch, but as I've described above, it's the warmth and kindness of the staff that really sets this place apart.

The room had a free computer and WiFi. The front desk, tour desk and restaurant staff, all excellent English speakers, couldn't do enough to help and were willing to take time to talk with us and give suggestions of things to do and places to see. The front desk staff even organised motorbikes for our use at US$8 a day. We had emailed the hotel prior to arriving in Hue to arrange pickup at the airport - we were coming directly from an overnight train, taxi and then early morning flight and didn't want the hassle of then finding a bus or taxi - the car was waiting for us and this luxury was worth the US$15 the hotel charged. It also meant that the hotel knew we would be arriving much earlier than the recommended check-in time and they gave us access to our room on arrival (at no extra cost). The hotel's buffet breakfast was very good and we could also request other food such as noodle soups, eggs or even pancakes. The restaurant has a wide selection of food on offer for the evening meal. We ended up having both our evening meals there selecting traditional Hue dishes, which were excellent and very reasonably priced. On leaving Hue we were going to take the train to Da Nang and then a car to Hoi An, however, the staff suggested booking a car. This way we would get to see all the scenery we would have from the train but also be able to stop anywhere and as often as we liked to take photos or visit places. The staff at the hotel organised this for us for US$65 and, among other things, we got to travel the Hai Van pass and visit the Marble Mountains and then be dropped at our hotel in Hoi An.

41852,"We selected this hotel based on the great reviews on Trip Advisor. Arriving into Hue in the evening, we pre organised the hotel pick up through the hotel. Pick up was seamless with the driver being on time, very friendly and in a nice car. Check in was easy, informative and welcoming.

The room was large with two double beds, plenty of room for our bags plus a table and two chairs. It also came with a desk with a computer (we used the wi-fi instead). The bathroom was very large, clean and with great water pressure in the shower.

The hotel assisted us with organising a day tour around Hue the next day. The driver ended up being the same guy who picked us up at the hotel. A lovely man who was informative, friendly and stopped as many times as we liked for photos. He gave us water throughout the day as well. Out only negative about this day is it was 40+ degrees and when we went to the Citadel instead of driving us a little closer and dropping us off near the main gate within the walls. He parked a little further away and didn't give us directions to the entry gate so we initially went to the wrong gate only to be sent to the other side. Not fun in the heat.

The hotel also booked me into a group DMZ tour. The tour was run by Huong Binh who maybe I got on a bad day but he was rude and wasn't the greatest tour guide. Yes, the sites were interesting but I wouldn't recommend doing this tour. Use a different DMZ guide or take one of the hotels private tours. I met those guides and they seemed lovely and informative.

Overall our stay at the hotel was really good. The staff at the hotel are so lovely and welcoming.

They booked flight tickets for us to Hanoi for a better price than we had found, but I heard from a local that it's cheaper to do this somewhere else. Ah well, if that is the only thing.

41852,"We chose this hotel base on the review on TripAdvisor.com and Booking.com and it was perfect choice. I stayed many different hotel from 1* to 5* in SEA but Serene Palace was the best.
- Room: Big, Western style, very clean and bright
- Breakfast: So nice, order to cook but very fast and fresh. I like their ""Pho"" so much.
- Staff: 10/10 for Serene Team who were very friendly and smiling. They always be ready to help you about the local info, arrange transportation (taxi, car...) We took their car to Hoi An and driver was so good and can speak English. We had fantastic time on the way to visit the Cloudy Pass, Marble Mountain and the beach.
Totally Serene Palace was the best stay in my trip. Thanks for all staff from Front Desk, Bellman, Waitress and Chef.

Breakfast was fine but not as fantastic in our opinion as many other reviewers but there was a fruit and juice offering and a menu of cooked egg dishes or Vietnamese noodles - perhaps we were spoilt coming from a previously reviewed hotel in Hanoi.

41821,"Average hotel

We stayed here for 4 nights, the hotel was ok but we thought they could change a few things to improve the quality of stay.
We received a lovely welcome from the reception, all staff couldn't do enough to help us during our stay and all very very pleasant.
The first thing I had to do when we arrived at our room was to tighten the toilet seat, which was very loose.
Our room was a really good size, which had 3 chairs, a table, a desk, a bedside table with a lamp but no socket nearby to power the lamp from. One cupboard for hanging clothes, 4 small shelves which were filled with ornaments and behind the shelves was the only mirror in the room, a fridge,a safe and a PC.
There was only one electrical socket in the room, no mirror in the room apart from the one hidden behind our clothes (we removed ornaments and put our clothes there).
In the bathroom is a bath with a hand held shower, no bracket for holding the shower, one socket which the hotels hair dryer (which lacked power) was plugged into, any of our personnel items fell out of both sockets, we managed to push a chair against the plug in the bedroom and there was a phone next to the socket in the bathroom which we wrapped the phone cable around our electrical plug to keep if in place.
The breakfast was ok, nothing special.
Improvements -

Add more electric sockets in room, with stronger springs in sockets to hold items, one socket isn't enough.
Remove lamp if it can't be used.
Add a large mirror in room next to an electric socket.
Add more shelving in room.
Remove chairs and ornaments.

We really enjoyed our time in Hue, but we both felt these little improvements would have made the quality of stay all the more better.

41821,"We stayed at Hue Serene Palace for 2 nights in a very spacious family room. I can't fault the hotel or the room for the price- it is excellent value. I had mentioned in an email that we were on a trip to celebrate my husbands birthday so he was treated to a bunch of flowers and a birthday cake on arrival. The staff even sang him Happy Birthday when they showed us to our room. Staff were very eager and attentive. Food was great. Location was excellent.
However, I'm only giving this hotel 4 stars as I don't like the way they try and get you to give a good Trip Advisor rating. Upon checkout we were asked how our stay was. I told them we were very happy, and of course they then requested a review on TA. We were met with this request many times on our trip, and I understand how important it is for new hotels to get a decent rating so I said yes I would. I was then asked by another staff member, 'how many stars will you give us?' I assured them I would give them five stars, as they were so eager. Then, when they showed us to our car, they asked, 'When do you think you will write your review? When you get to your next hotel?' I found this really off-putting. I obviously wasn't quick enough, as I have also received an email from them reminding me to review them with 5 stars.

Breakfast was good - the usual Vietnamese mix of fresh fruit and bread, plus whatever you want cooked to order. We also ate there one evening based on Trip Advisor reviews and although the food was great, the atmosphere was lacking (we prefer to sit outside in any event, which wasn't an option).

41791,"We reserved this hotel based on what we could read and see in tripadvisor and other travel websites. The ratings, reviews and pictures were good. The only apprehension was the location in a narrow alley off a main thoroughfare in a busy downtown area. As the taxi driver approached the alley he hesitated going in because of the narrowness and obstructions by motorbikes parking. Warning bells were ringing in my head, I had to walk in, asking for directions. Luckily the taxi managed to get through and we arrived at the front of the hotel, which stands out from the neighborhood. It has a nice clean front with attendants helping us off the taxi and carried our luggage to the air-conditioned reception area where we were seated and offered cold juice drinks and fresh cold towels to cool off.I mentally checked 1 plus for the hotel. After registration we were helped to the room with luggage, I mentally checked another plus, all the modern amenities were available including the excellent Wi-Fi reception, the bed was comfortable enough for two, the room and bath area sparkling clean, the air-conditioning was quick and highly responsive. The hotel has an integrated restaurant which took care of the free buffet breakfast, providing an excellent array of coffee, tea, juices, Western and Vietnamese style breakfast. One of my American colleague managed to have Pho for breakfast every morning for 3 mornings in a row. Could Pho be really that good in a hotel restaurant? I chose to stick to the royal three courses of coffee/juice at will followed by eggs/sausage/bread and cocktail of fresh fruits to cap off the morning meals. We discovered that the restaurant served very reasonable lunch and dinner for a very good price. So on a day when we were tired of being in town the hotel restaurant was our quiet retreat for a simple meals. The restaurant was the third plus. The fourth plus came from the staff, always smiling, helpful, catering to all of our needs including scheduling taxis and tours.

We paid what we were supposed without much trouble thanks to the receptionist. And there were freshly ground mango juice and freshly cut fruits waiting for us at the lobby.

The surprise continued with free upgrade for the first two nights, and the wonderful breakfast with so much fruit selection, and the motorbike tour they arranged for us that turned out to be wonderful.

There is room to improve the breakfast which was pretty greasy both mornings. Furthermore we ordered a double room, which consisted of 2 wide-singles pushed together then the 2 sets of sheets and duvets were laid horizontally across the bed, this led to waking up a little tangled when they could just get proper sized sheets and duvets!

Staff very friendly and welcoming in terms of day to day routine interactions with fairly good english but we found it difficult to get unbiased onward travel advice and information on local tours. The default position appears to be to encourage use of overpriced private cars and staff don't appear very well informed about tours or national/international travel e.g. buses or trains.

Unfortunately due to ""face"" issues if you ask about a novel/unknown topic then your likely to be made to feel awkward rather than helped to find an answer. Though this is obviously not unique to this hotel it happens all over Vietnam (and China).

Aside from these minor issues (plenty of useful information on blogs etc anyway) the stay was good and the location is at the more local end of the main drag in Hue so restaurant and bar prices a bit cheaper.

However what makes this hotel stand out above all others is the amazing staff that works there, they literally can't do enough for you.

41791,"My family’s stay in this hotel was very pleasant and enjoyable even though we only stayed for one night. The hotel kept up with the expectations I had based on the reviews of travellers who came ahead of us. As forewarned, I anticipated the narrow road leading to the hotel from the main road. But this road seemed interesting with its line of cafes. Too bad, we did not have the chance to try them. We had some difficulty finding the hotel because of the rather small sign posted among the clutter of other signs, but that was no big deal. The staffs, particularly the front liners Ken and Jenny, were all so welcoming and so were the other staffs that were equally warm, attentive and very helpful. Most of them spoke English which made our stay even more convenient. Welcome drink and fruits were served when we checked in. Having been out in the hot and humid summer day, the drinks were refreshing but it could have been more so if it were ice cold.

The room we had was spacious, beautiful and tastefully decorated with pastel colours contrasted with patches of brown. The hotel is relatively new and the room and bathroom were spic and span. The room came with complimentary fresh fruits, bottled water, sachets of ice tea and 3 in one coffee. It had a hot pot, mini-bar and flat screen TV with good English programs. ,

The restaurant was also very good. It is has just opened and the cooking was excellent. We enjoyed all the Vietnamese cuisines that we tried, like the banana flower salad, the vegetarian spring roll, the seafood fresh spring roll, fresh noodle with grilled pork and the traditional pancake with shrimp and pork. But what I missed was the authentic Bun Bo Hue, the Hue noodle soup. My first taste of this Hue noodle delicacy was in Ho Chi Minh and was looking forward to having the “real one” in Hue. I wish the Serene Restaurant will serve the original bun bo hue.

They had just opened a restaurant in the hotel and I ate there both nights, it was very nice and the Vietnamese wine was very cheap and quite palatable.
My biggest gripe was that there was no shower in the room, there was a shower attachment but there was nothing on the wall to attach it to so you had to crouch in the bath holding the shower over you, I know some people prefer a bath but when it's so hot you just want a nice cool shower. They also managed to stain a top that I had put in the laundry, they told me that the mark would come out but unfortunately it hasn't, the staff were very apologetic however and the price of the laundry was taken off my bill.

We arranged for the hotel driver to collect us from Hoi An ($65) which was great. The driver was on time and stopped off at a few places (Marble Mountains, Lang Co Beach and Hai Van Pass).

41760,"A group of friends gathered for 9 amazing days in VN, we booked 7 rooms six months in advance directly with the hotel. The staffs were very prompt and courstesy responding to all our inquiries. We were all agreed that Hue Serene was our #1 choice hotel compared to other hotels we had stayed during the entire trip. From a scale from 1 - 10, we would give it a 12 for the following reasons: The services from all the staffs (reception, breakfast staff, bellhop...) were excellent; the rooms were spacious, new and clean; the location was great with walking distance to many great restaurants, shops. When we first arrived, we were surprised that it located in the alley compared to the main street like many hotels we stayed. However, we later learned that this was the best location because it was quiet, we did not have to counter the noise, people selling on the street, and the area in this alley was nice as well. Just an example to a personal touch from the staff. We were there during Lent week and our tour scheduled to depart Hue to Hoi An at 9:30 am on a Palm Sunday. The night before, we searched the web for next morning early mass. We were just sitting at the reception area discussing about the alternative and mentioned that the website did not list all the mass schedules. One of the bellhop person rode his bike to the church and inquired about the time. Thus, some of us were able to attend the 6am mass and made it in time for the 9:30 am departure.",50,71,"Houston, Texas",961,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelDir,TravelDir,41730,Hidden gem in Hue,Trip type: Traveled with friends,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293926-d4357913-Reviews-or1890-Hue_Serene_Palace_Hotel-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html#REVIEWS

Upon arrival a call to them resulted in a quick pick up and were told they were there waiting most of the morning. Upon arrival at the hotel neatly situated on a narrow street a refreshing cool wet towel and drinks were provided to us and a very big welcome smile from the very tentative staff who all introduced themselves. Checking in was very efficient and soon we were in the honeymoon suite we had booked...fantastic large size room with a king sized bed upon which there were fresh flowers, a bottle of wine and a fresh cake...it was not our honeymoon but we just wanted to book that type of room.

The room and bathroom with a big walk in shower had everything...bathrobes, slippers,all toiletry items including tooth brush and paste, fresh fruit every day and bottled water ....a large sized balcony overlooking the street below and the city.

The hotel is perfectly situated with an easy walk to the river and many restaurants . Bikes are available to rent and we took full advantage during our stay to explore the city and surrounding area.

Breakfast was off the menue both American and local served with friendly and tentative staff who always remembered our names.In fact all of the staff did so.

The unique thing about the staff is that they all had English names so that it was easy for tourists like me to remember ....A special tank you to Emily who arranged chicken soup for me as I got sick within hours of getting there. That did the trick as I was ready to go the next day.

One comment: we pre-booked a city tour for $55 and thought it would be a guided tour, but the driver only spoke about 3 words of English (3 more than we knew in Vietnamese) and if we hadn't happened to have brought our guide book it would have been a pretty frustrating day.

41730,"We stayed at the Hue Serene Hotel for 2 nights. The staff are very helpful and cannot do enough for you, especially Jenny and Ken on reception. The location of the hotel is OK with about a 10 minute walk to some good restaurants. We were up on the top floor (7th floor) and couldn't hear the traffic noise or noise from any of the neighbouring rooms. The bed was probably the least comfortable out of the 5 hotels we stayed in during our Vietnam trip - very hard!

The hotel helped us organise a car and driver to take us to the royal tombs and pagoda and we had a very good, safe driver with a very comfortable car.

Wifi was ok - for some reason we couldn't connect to the router on the 7th floor so connecting to the 6th floor made it a little slow but still useable. There is a computer in the room which is handy for those who haven't brought their own tablet/laptop.

Breakfast was limited - there was a fruit buffet, and then you could order off the menu. Service was good, we were offered tea/coffee straight away and when we got up to leave they checked to see if we wanted anything else as we hadn't eaten a lot.

The hotel sells itself as a 'brand new hotel that features luxurious rooms and suites' - the reason that I am not giving the hotel 5 stars is because I would not describe the hotel as luxurious - for example there are a few things that gave our room a scruffy appearance such as the plug socket hanging out of the wall in our bathroom, only having a net curtain cover half of the window and only one bedside lamp that was glued to the bedside table! These things can easily be fixed and would give a much better impression.

Therefore, if getting a good price is important then this is the hotel for you as there is no denying it is good value for money. However, if you are looking for luxury I would suggest you look elsewhere.",40,285,"Brentwood, United Kingdom",574,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Holidaymad,Holidaymad,41730,Value for money,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293926-d4357913-Reviews-or1910-Hue_Serene_Palace_Hotel-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html#REVIEWS

As others said, do remember how to get back, but it's worth it, it gives you a feel how people really live there.

41730,"Ok, I said this before to my friends: this hotel is great! I traveled a lot through Vietnam, from Hanoi, to Cat Ba and Ha Long Bay, until I reached Hue. So I have plenty of experience with hotels and the service in Vietnam.
Generally people will be nice in Vietnam, at Serene Palace they are 10x nicer! What stroke me is that from the moment I arrived everyone seemed genuinely happy to see me. No fake smiles and they were extremely helpful. The staff will ask you to sit down while they make sure your room is ready and serve you a delicious fruit juice (nothing like I had before). You'll need that coming from 30-35 degrees Celcius. Even more someone will join you and answer all of your questions concerning the city and available tours.
They provide you with a city map and around Hue map, while even recommending vegetarian or massage places to go. If you get to this hotel ask for Julia, she is just divine! This girl will make sure you are 100% ready to venture out with everything you need. If you ask me she takes the hospitality service to a whole new level. There was nothing that she didn't know and they even rented us bikes.

41730,"Hue is a great city to spend a couple of days in while traveling through Vietnam. Was there for two nights and stayed at the Serene Palace. I wholeheartedly agree with the other reviewers regarding cleanliness, extra friendly staff, and great value for your money. It is located down a really narrow alleyway which can provide challenges for some vehicles to get through. No big deal but we had to walk to our tour bus one morning since it could not pass.

Location was also located near walkable restaurants, shops and cafes.

Some tips:
1. Bring earplugs because you just might hear a rooster very early in the morning. You will find this more common than not when touring Vietnam.
2. Breakfast is included! Nice selection to choose from which can include your typical egg platter with meat and toast, or you can opt for more Vietnamese inspired dishes like pho.
3. Nice amenities like a flat screen tv, free Wifi and work station with computers!
4. I found that I didn't need to buy an electric adapter for my devices. My chargers fit fine in the outlets. So don't spend extra money on adapter plugs!
5. Make sure you check out the Imperial City where the emperor ruled back in the day. Very massive and can take hours. Bring hats or umbrellas since walking in the heat can be overpowering.
6. The ""Perfume River"" is also a nice excursion to check out with it's beautiful flowing river with a scenic backdrop of mountains.

41730,"We recently stayed at the Hue Serene Palace Hotel and found it to be excellent value for money!
Location wise, it was a little difficult to find, but it is still a good location, easy walking distance to restaurants.
The room is excellent, with great amenities. We had two double beds so enjoyed the luxury of a big bed each! The quality of the room is very much what you'd find in a western style hotel, but at a tenth of the price you'd expect to pay for that type of room.
We personally found the staff a little over the top. Service in hotels in Vietnam is really quite exceptional and this is no exception, however, I really felt almost interrogated when we got back after a long day out. I know they are just doing their job and trying to be friendly, but for me, I prefer a I nice hello, I don't feel like having to explain everything I've done in the day. And on checking out, I'm not sure how many times I had to be asked if I enjoyed my stay or did I enjoy the breakfast!
And about the breakfast, seriously, it was beyond average. The cold toast and my fruit drink with grass in it!! The standard really needs to be lifted!
But again, having said that, the price we paid is reflected in the room alone, I guess breakfast is just a bonus! Personally I'd eat out if I were to stay there again.

The arranged pick up from the airport was seamless and we were welcomed, checked in and briefed regarding the hotel, services and tours with complimentary fruit and juice.

Breakfast was terrific and all cooked to order, fantastic pancakes served with a smile and a chat by the lovely girls.
What makes this hotel exceptional is the staff. Everyone we came in contact with went to great lengths to be welcoming and make our stay as good as it could be. This includes the bell boys, reception staff, housekeeping and the girls serving breakfast. All amazing!!

clean rooms, friendly staff and good price.

from the check-in we felt like king and queen in the hotel, the staff was
so nice to us. at the reception they informed us about everything we can do
in hue, what we should see and made us love the vietnamese...

so we came to the imperial city, visit the tien mu pagoda, some tombs and the citadel.

thanks to one of the receptionist ""miss si"", which took care of our desires...
we saw everything we intent to see in hue (known from the travel books).

We wanted to get the train down to Da Nang so we walked to the station to get tickets (30 mins) - its an easy straight road. Overall, nice hotel.

Talking about our train journey, we mentioned to reception that we were thinking of going to Da Nang (Hoi An) by train and could they help us get tickets. From which, we were told that the hotel could sort out a car for us for a similar price. When we asked for clarification on the price of the car, we were told it was $65. We then said that the train was only $8 and that it wasn't a similar price do we declined the car option. Feeling a bit miffed at us not wanting to take the car, the girl behind reception (Si) bluntly told that if we wanted to go by train, we would have to go to the station and sort the tickets out ourselves (which we did).

the breakfast is outstanding with Asian and Western food, yoghurt, 7 kinds of fresh fruit, any type eggs and true vietnamese coffee with condensed milk (try it, it is strong and beautiful).

but the hotel's greatest asset are the staff. they are courteous, try to remember all the guests names and greet you by name when you arrive for breakfast, get out of the lift or get back to the hotel.

the hotel is situated close to restaurants and entertainment, it is in a narrow street off the main road, which makes it quite.

this hotel group has another few hotels in Hannoi and i am sorry i had made previous bookings for Hanoi because i would have loved to stay in one of their Hanoi hotels.
speaking to other travellers who had stayed in Hanoi, they said it was fantastic (i think the names in Hanoi were Serene Hotel-Hanoi and Hanoi Charming Hotel 1 and 2 and Hanoi Holiday Diamond Hotel)

early reservations are necessary because they are often booked out.

41699,"Where can i start!
My partner and I stayed at the Hue Serene palace hotel for 3 nights in our month long trip in Vietnam. After the hotel we were staying at previously in Hue was booked out we had to find a quick replacement close by. Within minutes of inquiring, Jenny (a very helpful receptionist) emailed me back with a confirmation and next thing we knew a hotel staff member had walked in the rain, 2 umbrella's in hand, to pick us up from our first hotel which was around the corner.
Once we arrived we were greeted by such smiling faces we were instantly impressed. We had a complimentary fruit platter, welcome drink and tea and coffee before we were taking up to our room.

The room was amazing. For a cost of $35 USD a night i felt like I was staying a a flash 5 star hotel. It was immaculate, clean, bed was comfortable, bathroom was big with a bathtub (which was perfect as the weather was quite cold and wet) and the TV had a fantastic range of channels.

The location was central, only a 5 minute walk to shops, restaurants and bars. Ordering a taxi through reception was easy and would arrive with minutes.

The door boys were very well presented and always helping you with bags and supplying umbrellas!

Breakfast was a fruit buffet and a menu that you could choose as many meals as you wanted, all inclusive in room rate. I have got to say, out of our whole month trip of Vietnam, this was BY FAR the best breakfast we had.

Now for the best part. My boyfriend was very unwell on our 3rd day at the hotel so we had to cancel our car to Hoi An and stay an extra night - which of course they accommodated for us without any problems, amazing. Within an hour of extending our stay the staff came to our room to get our bags and relocate to our new room.
They brought breakfast to our room for him as he was too sick to get out of bed. Later on in the day they brought him so toast and tea. Then in the afternoon they brought him a fresh juice. The staff here truly went above and beyond to help us out.
As i would pass through the lobby they would constantly ask if there was anything they could do to assist him or if they could call the doctor. We are both very very grateful for how the staff accommodated us.

Special thanks to Mary, Jenny, Julia, Emily and the rest of the staff at the Hue Serene Palace Hotel. We honestly had the best experience and I would highly recommend staying here. I cannot fault this hotel one bit.

The location was perfect for walking around town and seeing the sites. There were plenty of restaurants and cafés nearby. Our room was very large and extremely clean. The breakfast was excellent, especially the pho! The hotel is not huge, so it was very quiet and personnel. The best part was the staff. They were all so helpful and friendly. The answered all our questions and recommended good restaurants and shopping. They also arranged our driver for the day we toured the Royal Tombs and the same driver for our drive to Hoi An.

41699,"I travel weekly for work all over the world staying in some fairly upmarket hotels (which I fortunately have to thank my employer who picks up the tab). So when I came to Hue on a holiday, I was greeted with a smile and warm personal service that not even the Hilton or Pullman could match.

We were checked in by Ken who took great care in looking after us, offering a drink and a light refreshment even though we arrived after hours.

In the morning, ALL of the hotel customer facing staff had learnt my name and were greeting us immediately.

The ladies in the breakfast were engaging and remembered orders from previous days. They also remembered that I promised to eat more next time. They're certainly not stingy!! Very generous indeed.

Door staff, particularly Tom and Henry were always happy. I don't think I saw Tom with anything other than a big broad smile on his face when he saw a customer.

As alluded, breakfast was generous, tasty and well presented. Hygiene is important and the hotel and public spaces are cleaned and tidied.

Beds are a bit on the fim side. Probably too firm in all honesty. I can live with that for a few nights but more than a week I would struggle.

Surrounding ambient & environmental noise is present. Not unbearable, not unpleasant, but bring ear plugs if you are a light sleeper in this part of the world.

This is a fab hotel, nicely styled, conveniently located to most of the sites without being tacky.

But by far it's best assets are it's staff - absolutely amazing.

41699,"What an a complete delight it was to stay at the Serene Palace! Firstly we'd been on the night train from Hoi An and arrived at the hotel at 9am. We weren't supposed to check in until 2 or 3 pm but we just hoped that we could leave our bags and maybe wander around until it was checking in time. We arrived at the hotel and the bell boys were straight out picking up our bags. We explained to the lady on the desk that we weren't due until later but could we leave our bags? They said ""no problem, please come and have complimentary breakfast"". We'd not slept for probably 24 hours and we were saying oh no but we are disgusting we've been on the night train and we arent booked until later. They said ""please dont worry you're room isnt ready so we have upgraded you to another room and when you've had some breakfast you can go up immediately and shower"" We were totally blown away, we were paying £75 for 3 nights with breakfast and here we were being effectively given a free night and breakfast. We ate a tremendous breakfast (and that was the same every morning - gorgeous and fresh - a really lovely pho bo too) and the ladies in the breakfast area were so lovely, they insisted on knowing our names and then constantly using them, which was incredibly cute because they smiled every time they got our names right! After breakfast we were taken to our room and it was a lovely room with a bath with a jacuzzi! The bath itself was a tad too small for us (my hubby is 6ft 6inch) but it was still a bit special. Really clean and, as with everywhere in Vnam free wifi! Room was comfortable but a tad noisy from bar across the road and bloody cockrell at 5am every morning :) but it didn't detract from how we felt about this place. It really was a pleasure and we were seriously sad to leave. Hue is not the greatest of places to stay for a long time, lots of backpackers hanging around waiting for something to happen, but if you're coming to Hue then you cannot do better than stay at this hotel.

Location was very good, being close to lots of restaurants, bars, shops etc in the old town area, and just a short walk to the river and citadel. The hotel helped us to organise a car and driver to take us around on the first day, and also to book our train tickets, really couldn't have asked anything more of them. The breakfast had some good options, but I prefer a buffet when I'm away as I can never decide what to have and want to try a little bit of everything!

Just a heads-up. Located on a small alley, don't be scared as your car/driver approaches this dark lane. It is safe! My husband and I walked around the area on our own each night and it was totally fine.

The only thing to note is that the water heater runs out pretty quickly. Even if my husband took a shower at night and I took one in the morning, I couldn't stay in there for a long (or even normal) amount of time before the water would start getting cold. Again - at this price though, it really is a great value.

41671,"During the last three weeks we have been in many hotels in Vietnam and this one is by far the best experience we had. Where to start.... First they arranged transport from the Da Nang Airport to the Hotel, this was excellent and the Driver also had a paper with our name on it making it easy to identify him. When we arrived at night we were greeted by a fruit plater and a nice smile. Emily is the lady that welcomed us and she was really nice and answering all our questions. She then came with us to show us our room, it was a nice room (BIG), nice shower, nice bed, laudry service (cheaper than anywhere we went in Vietnam), nice balcony... every amenities you expect from a 4-5 stars Hotel at a fraction of the price. Breakfast was superb with a lot of choices; including Pho and Western Food... and the best.... you can order as many things as you want!!!
In the morning, we talked to Emily at the front desk, we asked her about the attractions that were in the Cities and she gave us a Map including everything, she even gave us the price of every attractions and could arrange a driver for us for the day at a reasonable cost. We had a friend that went to another Hotel to look at the tours they were offering and the other Hotel had the same tour for 30$ more dollars. Based on that we can certainly say that the staff at the Serene Palace Hotel are the most honest you can find :)
The Hotel is well located, in a quiet street. You can basically walk 3 minutes and you will be in the action of Hue with all the local people. The Hotel is very safe (all new doors and windows) we went walking at night with no problem and there are many Coffee Shop close by. Everything in the Hotel is new and clean with great Architectural Design. Anyway I will stop there because I could talk hours from the great experience we had at the Serene Palace.

41671,"We stayed for two nights at the Serene Palace (2 separate occasions) and we could not fault it given the very good tariff.
It is certainly as good as many 4 star hotels we have stayed in and for service, it is far better and attentive than most 5 star hotels.
The staff are very welcoming, friendly, polite and helpful from the minute you arrive. We did notice that there seemed to be a few staff ""in training"" and it was great to see how they were being well looked after and supported and never undermined by the ""experienced"" staff - a very good HR operation is in place.

The welcome drink and fruit platter was a real surprise along with the fresh fruit plate in your room - they seem to go out of their way to go the extra mile in hospitality.
The rooms are a good size, very clean and the personal computer was great. We just wanted to stay in our room and chill out as it felt comfortable as soon as you entered.

We booked a tour with the very helpful guidance of the staff to see the local sites plus a few other places that we wanted to see and the driver John could not have been more polite and accommodating. We picked up English speaking guides when we could onsite which worked well.
The hotel also arranged our transfer north which included stops on the way and a very long 8.5 hr day and John was also our driver on this. The recommendation by a hotel of private drivers does very much reflect back on them and in our case, they once again get top marks.
The staff are very knowledgeable and proud of their city and this is a bonus for tourists.

On one of our arrivals at the Serene, our train was an hour and half late but at the station was a staff member to greet us, still smiling. Due to the late hour and needing dinner they promptly organised delivery from a local restaurant for us. Once again, the staff were so obliging.

The Hue Serene definitely gets our tick of approval and we will be recommending it. Look forward to hopefully returning next year to see the sights of Hue that we missed this trip - an interesting and we felt somewhat underrated city by a lot of people.

He took me on all of the back roads where I was able to see and interact with locals and see these amazing temples come out of nowhere!! He was overly nice and considerate throughout my day with him.

Probably fine to stay here if you like every little step being taken care of for you (including toasting your own toast or picking up your own baguette from the buffet) but we would probably choose somewhere with a slightly more normalised relationship between the staff and customers next time.",30,7,NA,13,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LordLadyButtongrass,LordLadyButtongrass,41640,Reverse Fawlty Towers Experience!,NA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293926-d4357913-Reviews-or2060-Hue_Serene_Palace_Hotel-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html#REVIEWS

41640,"In terms of value and friendliness of the staff this hotel is hard to beat. Stayed there three nights at the end of December and absolutely enjoyed it. Of course not everything in this hotel is made of marble and rosewood. Our room also did not have much of a view. But what do you expect at those rates? And it was warm and cozy -- temperatures were quite low at the time of our stay. They kind of managed to make four stars out of two. Chances are that after a couple of days at the Hue Serene Palace Hotel everything else in Vietnam will seem somewhat overpriced. They do have a little markup on tours that you book through them and they will try to sell you one first thing after checking in, but we were very impressed by the fact that they changed our Dollars into Dong at the bank rate.

41640,"The Hue Serene Palace Hotel was an incredible value, so I had no idea what to expect. We arrived on the overnight train from Hanoi exhausted (due to our battles with cockroaches on the train), and the staff instantly welcomed us with a free breakfast. Let me say right now that their breakfast spreads are consistently awesome. A choice of cook-to-order items like eggs or pho as well as a fantastic fruit spread including exotic fruits like dragonfruit and passionfruit (two of my personal faves). The waitstaff and front desk staff spoke much better English than almost everywhere we encountered in Vietnam.

Despite our early arrival and cheap rate, we were given a prompt check in as well an upgrade to a more spacious room. Awesome! The room is generally quite comfortable and spacious with a small balcony, very clean. The mattresses are a bit firm for American standards, which is quite comfortable for European standards. Rooms are fairly quiet for Vietnam standards, although there will be ambient noise from the outside most places. The hotel is centrally located and a short walk from the Perfume River.

I just want to say that this was hands-down about the best service I've experienced anywhere. The front desk went out of their way to be genuinely friendly and helpful. My friend was not feeling well and spent most of the day in bed. The front desk staff somehow remembered my name and asked several times how Mr. Andrew was doing. They arranged a very reasonably priced motorbike tour for me to the sights around town. When I returned, one of the friendly ladies at the front desk, got me a complementary fresh-squeezed fruit juice and sat down for a chat to ask about my day. Where does that happen! Awesome.

Like I said, the service made this hotel a shining spot in our visit to Vietnam at a reasonable price. We were sad to leave and subsequently found that this level of hospitality is not universal in Vietnam.

Just a note about Tripadvisor and Vietnam I'm adding to all my reviews:
Unfortunately, in my research for the trip, I discovered a huge number of fake reviews on TripAdvisor in Vietnam, a much higher fraction than in the west. They're mostly pro, but a few con from competitors. Take your time to read the quality reviews from reviewers with multiple reviews in multiple cities.

Negatives? Only minor things: the restaurant only serves breakfast, so if you want a snack at other times, you have to go out; the breakfast is fine, but the menu not that extensive. Also, the hot water runs to cold when the bath (which is a Jacuzzi!) is half full.
But for the price, this has to be one of the best bargains I've seen.

41640,"Upon arriving from our transfer from da nang to the hotel (US$60 organised by the hotel a day ahead), the owner came out and thanked us for choosing his hotel.

We were then asked to take a seat and 'would u like tea or coffee?' Emily (staff member) then bought hot tea with fruit... Including passion fruit! Emily was so lovely. Made conversation, jokes and made us laugh.

Emily took us to our room - 7th floor. Amazing views, 2 large beds, big shower with detachable head and rain shower head(!), computer with Internet (fast as well as wifi), tv with English stations and asked 'is this ok?' WOW!

Then we visited a vegetarian cafe and their directions were perfect.

Breakfast in the morning was the best we've had all around south east Asia. Eggs, pho, bacon, pancakes, fruit, tea, coffee... And you don't chose one from the menu - chose as many as u like! I suggest the omelet with everything and then pancakes with banana and honey, then add passion fruit to them.

I cannot speak highly enough about this place. I know it's a bit more than the usual $10 or less backpackers but the breakfast and hospitality make it worth spending a touch more.

However watch out for taxi drivers especially from the train station. They take you to a different hotel and tell you its the Hue Serene Palace.

Like all small hotels in Vietnam, there is only one lift, and the best rooms are on the top floor. During my stay, there was a power failure, but only temporary, and luckily I was in my room. The only complaint I have is that the hotel is located on a dirt lane. During the wet season (which is very often in Hue), the lane is muddy so that you have to avoid puddles of wet ground.

41609,"Have to admit to being a little disheartened when arriving in Hue - the weather was awful - cold and raining so probably didn't get the best view of this coming in.

The Serene Palace had arranged our transfer from Da Nang airport - they arrived on time and we had a good journey to the hotel - cost about $60 US. On arrival we were greeted with fresh fruit and tea and one of the staff came over and went into some detail about the tours on offer. I don't think they are trying to do a hard sell by any means but could definitely understand previous negative reviews of this because after a long journey you probably just want to get to your room!

When we did eventually get to the room we were pleased with it - it was a really good size - very large bed and everything you would want in it (apart from breakfast tea and milk!). The mini bar was adequately stocked and it was relatively cheap.

It was a good sized bathroom with a rainforest shower although the hot water does run out if you're in there too long!

Breakfast was ok, the staff are very attentive and will be with you straightaway to take your order. I thought the Pho was pretty poor compared with many that I have had in Vietnam, so on the second day I had scrambled eggs which were fine. My boyfriend had the pancakes which were tasty despite being a little crunchy! You can also help yourself to fresh fruit of which there is much variety.

The hotel is in a good location - it's on a little alley where if you turn left coming out of the hotel within 2 minutes you're in the areas where the bars and restaurants are. The DMZ bar is a popular one with Westerners and I really enjoyed it there. Great place for a beer, you can watch the football and the food is pretty good too. The hotel also recommended that we went to the Golden Rice restaurant which we did - nice cute place (especially with the doors shutting out the cold!) - food was so / so but pleasant enough.

The hotel is also a 20 minute walk from the Imperial City - it's really worth going to this (even in the rain!) - take a Rough Guide or Lonely Planet with you and it will give you more than enough information on the buildings there - plan for a good half day. The market is about 10 minutes from there and it's huge!! You'll be able to buy pretty much anything.

We booked a trip to the DMZ with the hotel. This was a full day tour - our guide could have done with speaking better English - it felt like the driver had a better grasp of what was going on and he was definitely more entertaining. However - it was a good tour - you get to cross the bridge which was the North / South divide, you go to the Vinh Moc Tunnels (which I thought were far better than the Cu Chi in HCM) and to the Quang Tri Citadel (which is basically being rebuilt). You also go to many 'memory monuments' with accompanying museums which talk about the American War (can start to feel a little propaganda-ish)The tour cost $95 with the guide.

And then finally - the hotel booked our car for the journey to Hoi An and this was brilliant. Cost $65 and we were on the road for around 5 hours stopping on Lang Co beach, crossing the Hai Van pass and spending a really good hour at Marble Mountain - I would definitely recommend you doing this with the hotel.

Would give a special mention to Judy/Julie )?) who was brilliant as front of house. My boyfriend was pretty sick on the day we arrived and she was really good with getting him ginger tea (apparently good for sickness!) and checking constantly that he was getting better.

I am pretty sure that if the sun is shining Hue is a wonderful place - and I would say that the Serene Palace would be a very good, and cheaply priced hotel to stay at.",40,298,London,619,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TerriLondon,TerriLondon,41609,It's the staff that make this hotel,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293926-d4357913-Reviews-or2110-Hue_Serene_Palace_Hotel-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html#REVIEWS

41609,"I stayed at the Hue Serene Palace for two nights in room 403. This is a solid three star hotel, but there are definitely things that could be improved.
Pros:
*The hotel is new, so rooms are fresh and quite clean.
*Bathroom is big, great water pressure and hot water; beware getting out of the tub - I stepped out the first time and it was a longer way to the floor than I expected. I climbed out after that.
*Definite A for effort for the staff - there are a lot of them and they try very hard; they are also very receptive to feedback.
*Price is really good for the quality of room - I paid only $25 on a special ""just opened"" promotion.
*Area is decent, only about 10 minutes walking to the key streets with restaurants and shops.
*They recommended a great motor bike tour to see key sites because I only had one day in Hue: this was an excellent experience.
Cons:
*I arrived at night and the staff that checked me in did so efficiently, but their English wasn't great so they couldn't answer some of my other questions; the staff the next morning had better English and provided excellent recos about a gym and a tour to key sites.
*Breakfast is so so in terms of food quality, but again staff get A for effort on service.
*Beds are incredibly hard - like wooden board hard; also, I had an issue with some bugs found on the mattress cover (NOT bed bugs, but still unsettling) - the staff came up right away to address the issue and sent housekeeping to completely strip and remake the bed with new linens, mattress and duvet covers.
*Perfume scent is very strong in the detergent they are using on towels and robes; this should be changed if possible.
*Plugs are really inconvenient - one at one end the room by the chair, and one hidden behind the mattress. I had to pull the mattress out to be able to charge stuff.

I was very honest with my feedback, and the staff credited me one night of my stay as a result of the bug inconvenience. I appreciated the gesture for sure.
I think the property itself is a good solid choice for clean, new, mid range accommodations, and amenities are decent for a three star; once the staff iron out some kinks, I think the overall experience will go from average/good to excellent.",30,20,Toronto,84,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/axylady,axylady,41609,"Pretty good, need to iron out some kinks",Trip type: Traveled solo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293926-d4357913-Reviews-or2110-Hue_Serene_Palace_Hotel-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html#REVIEWS

From helping us find alternative accommodation for our one night early arrival (as they were fully booked) to excellent facilities, the Serene Palace Hotel contributed to our memorable stay in Hue. All the staff were excellent and the complimentary breakfast was much appreciated. Although situated on a side road, it was easy to get to the main road to find a taxi (or simply walk to a nearby restaurant). I cannot speak highly enough of this new (at the time) hotel. I would recommend it to families, couples and single travelers.

It is a new hotel and so everything is clean and new, the rooms are large and well furnished and having access to a computer in the room is very handy. The breakfast was a wide spread and very tasty, with buffet fruit and all you can eat ala carte menu. The staff were all very pleasant and welcoming. The only downside to this hotel is its location, quite a walk to the ancient citadel.

The staff went out of their way to make our stay as comfortable as possible, initially we were booked as a party of 3 in a twin room and a trundle bed, but the twin room was quite small so free of charge they upgraded us to the much larger family room with 2 queen beds and they put another trundle in their, making it very comfortable.

41609,"We had the pleasure of staying at this hotel for 1 night after arriving on the SE1 sleeper from Hanoi, a 13 hour journey may I add.We were shattered and bit delirious after our journey, the taxi took us down some back streets and we were a bit concerned as to where the hotel was. We needn't have worried as from the moment we arrived at the hotel there was a whirlwind of geniunely kind and helpful people, they offered us a free breakfast which was delicious, it wasn't a 'choose 1 item from the menu' deal, we could order as much as we wanted. Anyway, as we were short on time we wanted to fit in a visit to the DMZ as well as visit the main attraction in Hue, the citadel. Within an hour, a driver and a guide had been organised for us along with the assistance of exchanging our train tickets for later train the next day so we would have time to visit the citadel. All with, and I'll say this again, with genuine care and kindness.
After our excellent and informative visit to the DMZ, we finally checked into our room which was extremely great value for money, it came with two double beds, a computer, water, fruit and was clean and spacious, a very high standard.

The staff are really helpful in providing maps and organising tours, however we did the boat tour to the tombs and citadel and didn't really enjoy it. You end up being captive audience for sales pitch from the owner of the boat and felt uncomfortable because it was jut the two of us. You can have lunch on the boat for the journey back from the tomb had this been explained to us we might have had it but it was over priced and the menus handed to us straight away and we'd only just eaten breakfast so were confused! Then an array of items were put in front of us and we thought if we brought something that would take the pressure off but no on the return journey we had to say no several times to the clothes they were trying to sell us. I think if we'd known what to expect it wold have been fine, the owners of the boat were only trying to make a living and it was a good hours journey to the tomb so worth the $35 tour price but just be aware!

The room was very nice, clean, and spacious, with nice linens. The bed was a little firm for my preference, and when I mentioned it they put an extra duvet under the bottom sheet which really did make a difference. You can probably find a similar room for less money, but where this hotel really shines is how they will go above and beyond in terms of service. We mostly dealt with Miss Emily, who is a total delight, and Miss Helen, very adept on the computer, but the entire staff seems genuinely motivated in doing whatever they can to make your stay enjoyable and problem-free. One area that could use some fine-tuning is the breakfast, which offers some items to be cooked to order from a menu and other items that are laid out on buffet-type tables, but it was a little unclear as to whether it was meant to be a self-serve buffet.

41579,"This hotel was built in July so everything is still in excellent shape. Got a taxi from the train station as we had traveled down from Hanoi. Initially I was a bit disappointed as the hotel is located down a alley that does get muddy when it rains and the exterior is very plain.

However all that changed once we got inside the hotel, we were welcomed by fresh fruit drinks and warm towels.

We stayed in a Superior room which was very spacious. It included a pc and flat screen tv with Vietnamese and English channels.

It is very close to the river and central Hue. Lots of restaurants/shops within 5-15 minute walk including two recommended restaurants by Lonely Planet.

The staff are extremely helpful and nice, after checking in we went out for lunch and the staff immediately gave us umbrellas as it looked like it might start to rain. About 2 minutes later it started to really come down and we were thankful for the umbrellas.

When we came back from sightseeing for the day, staff would offer us drinks and towels to freshen up before heading back to our room. Staff's level of English is pretty good and every question we asked was promptly answered. They even helped my dad locate and buy some Vietnamese coffee.

The breakfast is done via a menu so everything is freshly made with a good selection of Western and Vietnamese items offered.",50,94,"Vancouver, B.C.",3050,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Techboy,Techboy,41548,Excellent staff and hotel,Trip type: Traveled with family,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293926-d4357913-Reviews-or2150-Hue_Serene_Palace_Hotel-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html#REVIEWS

This level of service continued through our stay getting to the hotel we were greated by the ever smiling manager Ken. He went out of his way to greet every guest by name and make sure they were happy. The hotel itself was lovely it is new and is in excellent condition as you would expect from a new hotel.

The breakfast was good with a wide variety of food cooked to order, they also said they woudl try and make anything else you wanted if it wasnt on the menu but the noodle soup and some fresh fruit set us up nicely each day.

Possibly the nicest hotel we have stayed in while travelling around the world and at the price we got the room it was exceptional value.

We walked to the citadel from the hotel which is easily acheivable for anyone, we used the hotels car service to go to the tombs this was a little expensive but probably in line with other hotels for hiring a private car, If your on a budget you might want to stop in to one of the travelers cafes and see what they can offer you or negotiate with a moto driver to take you.

The hotel is located in a quite alley but this is within easy walk to the main restaurant and bar area.

41548,"I stayed in 4 hotels during my recent trip to Vietnam and this was the best hotel. The good reviews are justified. As others have mentioned, the hotel is only 2 months old but it is the staff that makes it very special. All the hotel employees are warm, friendly and very helpful eg, Laura (restaurant staff) asked me my name (which is not easy to pronounce) and the next day, every single of the restaurant staff greeted me by name and they did this for all the other hotel guests too. Tina (reception) will organise tours for you and will even make suggestions and help organise the best /cheapest way to the airport.

Pros: Warm, friendly staff. Great breakfast (best cheese & tomato omelette I have had), computer and free wifi in room (however be careful as my computer had spyware), fruits and drinks on arrival, complimentary drinks if you’re waiting in their lounge, cheap laundry (US$2 /1 kg), full range of complimentary bathroom toiletries. fruit plate in your room.

41548,"As others have pointed out, this hotel is an incredible bargain. Rooms are spacious, amenities are well-stocked, and the location puts you within walking distance of most of the sights in Hue.

But what really makes this hotel stand out from others is the level of service and attention to detail provided by the staff, which was absolutely outstanding. Not only do they provide welcome drinks and always greet you with a smile, but they're also willing to go the extra mile for guests. I arrived at the hotel late at night after a long day and a flight from HCMC, and didn't really feel like going out for dinner, preferring instead to have a bite to eat in the room and go to bed early. The staff offered to send up a bowl of hot noodles to my room, which were much appreciated.

After a few days in Hue, I flew to Hanoi and checked in at their sister property. Upon arrival, I noticed that one of my shirts was missing from my suitcase; I figured that I must have accidentally left it in Hue. I sent them an email to see if I had, and not only did they locate the shirt, but offered to send it straight to my hotel in Hanoi. I don't know how they did it (perhaps one of the staff members was already traveling to Hanoi and offered to bring it?), but when I arrived back at my Hanoi hotel the next day, there was my shirt!

Overall, a customer service experience that went way beyond my expectations and one that made my stay at this hotel a true delight. They opened quite recently (during summer 2013) and are really doing their best to make an excellent first impression. If you're going to Hue, stay at the Serene Palace; you'll be glad you did.",50,15,Boston,16,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toml653,Tom L,41518,"Absolutely fantastic service, very highly recommended",Trip type: Traveled solo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293926-d4357913-Reviews-or2220-Hue_Serene_Palace_Hotel-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html#REVIEWS

He spoke to several staff who couldn't find our booking. So we booked over the phone and made arrangements for an airport transfer. What transpired the next day can only be described as confusion and prolonged discussions about our booking. Breakfast was weird with bacon that wasnt bacon.

41518,"We stayed at Hue and in Serene Palace Hotel for two nights and absolutely loved it. The staff was so very friendly and helpful and did everything that we felt comfortable. I think they were one of the few people in Vietnam, who spoke excellent English and even some words of German!
The rooms were very clean and spacious for an attractive price (20 USD promotion off-season for superior double room per night), with an own computer, TV and DVD and, as in all Hotels of the ""Holiday-Group"", with a reasonable price for beverages out of the minibar.
The breakfast was excellent and when we got soaked one night due to a tropical storm, they arranged for ordering dinner as we could not leave again because of the heavy rain, flooding and power blackout. A little note: the emergency power generator in the hotel works fine :D
They also arranged first seats in our night bus back to Hanoi for us as we had to stay next to the toilet on our first night bus before at the other direction and did not want to travel that way again. So we were picked up first and could select our ""accommodation"". Before leaving, we were allowed to have a shower in a special room which was also very clean.

41518,"My wife and I stayed here recently for one night as part of our honeymoon tour around Vietnam and Cambodia. We got a special offer price of $20 for the night and they included a free early morning check-in and breakfast on arrival for us, which was a great and very welcome bonus.

The breakfast is decent and the rooms are a good size, very nicely decorated and clean (the beds are much harder than I like, though this is pretty common in Vietnam), with a good safe to leave your valuables in, as you'd expect for a fairly new hotel. In addition to that, the staff were all tremendous, being hugely friendly and helpful, with very good English too, should that be important to you (my wife is Vietnamese, so this isn't a concern for us).

The location is down a small side street/alley, which is fairly common in Vietnam and it's not too far away from the main attractions and town centre. If you want a taxi, go for Mai Linh (green taxis), as they're a national company and usually very reliable and legitimate. The number on the meter is the price you pay, so if it says 30, that equates to 30,000VND and a tip rounded up to the nearest 5,000 or 10,000VND is the norm.

If you're going to Hue, definitely check this place out, as the quality of the hotel and its staff are way above anywhere else in this price band, with service on a level with a lot of way more expensive and allegedly higher quality establishments.

The rooms are big, very clean, and have a good internet-linked computer inside. The location is very good, because although at first it might seem that it is in a shady alley, the truth is that said alley is very calm, and close to the restaurants and bars, as well as a 15-20 minute walk away from the Citadel.
But the best thing about this Hotel is the super friendly and helpful staff. Upon arrival we were greeted with a delicious plate of fresh fruit and big smiles, they let us check-in way before time, and tried to help our visit to Hue in every way they could. If you have a problem, just talk to them, they will help! Especially Emily and Mary, who did the impossible to help us out, and save us time, bother, and money.

The city is quite noisy (like most cities in Vietnam), but in the room it’s very quiet so you can get a good night rest.

When we arrived, we were welcomed by friendly and informative staff and a welcome drink.
The room was very clean, bed comfortable and new quiet A/C units.
Breakfast was very good with ""order from the menu hot food"" (no limit in how much you can order), fresh fruit and nice coffee. The staff encouraged us to order more food from the menu as they said ""it makes us happy if we enjoyed and liked their food"".
After we checked out, we had an 8 hour wait for our night train, however the hotel let us keep our backpacks at the hotel, use their push bikes for free and when we returned from our day of exploring on the bikes, allowed us to use their shower before we boarded the train.
All staff spoke good English and were very friendly.
One tip, is that the place can be hard to find initially as it is down a side alley off the Main Street. Their is a small hotel sign at the end of the alley way (similar to a street sign size) which can be easy to miss!.

41487,"We had such a good time staying at this brand new hotel. From the front counter receptionists to the kitchen staff, everybody all the time is genuinely sweet, friendly and open... The room is clean, spacious & nicely decorated, but my daughter & I felt completely at home and relax mostly thanks to these girls and boys working the floors. They're still working on finishing things up (our curtain was taken away while we were there in our room for fixing, the breakfast menu isn't fully available...), but we can just oversee these little things and enjoy our stay.

41487,"We were extremely well greeted at this small hotel situated in a calm alley in the city of Hue. The bellboy saw us arrive in the alley and ran to help us with our bags and brought them for us inside the hotel. We were welcomed by smiling employees who offered us a nice welcome drink and a plate of fruits! While we were relaxing with our drinks, someone came to see us to provide us with a map of the city showing us the main attractions and giving us insights on great restaurants in the area. They even gave us the name of some local dishes that they thought we would enjoy trying! THIS IS SERVICE! We were then shown to our lovely room (pretty new and very clean might I add) where we had free water bottles, coffee and iced tea. The breakfast was great: nice selection of fruits, juices, coffee and tea and you could have pancakes (banana, honey, chocolate), toasts with jam and butter, eggs as you like them with bacon, ham or a typical Vietnamese breakfast - yummy! A special thank you to our 2 new friends Cathy and Julia - those are their nicknames for the guests...again everything to make our stay extremely pleasant :)",50,6,"Montreal, Canada",6,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/verog475,Vero G,41487,AMAZING small hotel in Hue - Top of the line service,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293926-d4357913-Reviews-or2280-Hue_Serene_Palace_Hotel-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html#REVIEWS

41456,"Amazing stay in this brand new hotel, 2weeks old I think. The least expensive hotel at e10 a night and definitely one of the best I've ever stayed in. Staff were fantastic, so pleasant, friendly, eager to please and really enjoyed talking to and it seemed getting to know the guests. On arrival we were given cold drinks,cold towels and fruit.Given a map and recommended certain restaurants and tours but in a friendly as opposed to a pushy manner.Rooms were beautiful, good size and very clean. Bathroom sizeable and clean-no shower curtain yet but I'm sure it will be installed, wasn't a problem!Location of hotel is very close to restaurants, bars etc though is down a small lane and at present it seemed people around the area including taxi drivers knew it as the ""new hotel"" but is not difficult to find. During our stay they were paving outside and when we woke at 9, there was drilling outside but I imagine it will be finished in a week or so and will be fabulous. Breakfast was cooked fresh as you order from an extensive menu where no request was a problem, just fantastic service! For such a reasonable price and a fantastic place it is certainly a hotel that shouldn't be overlooked!!",50,3,"Dublin, California",13,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/irishtravel_10,irishtravel_10,41456,"Brand new, fantastic find.",NA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293926-d4357913-Reviews-or2280-Hue_Serene_Palace_Hotel-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html#REVIEWS
